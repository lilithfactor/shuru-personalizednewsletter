Bringing in recommendations from someone with no framework of risk and harms to highly marginalized people leads to proclamations of “authenticating all humans.” This seems to be a push to remove online anonymity, something I’ve written about very personally. It is ill-thought-through, harmful to those most at risk, and backed by no actual methodology or evidence.

Wade are mortally under threat. With the projected criminalization of those seeking or providing abortion services, it has become more and more apparent that the tools and technologies most used for accessing vital health care data are insecure and dangerous.Let’s back up. Last month, Russian police coerced protesters into unlocking their phones to search for evidence of dissent, leading to arrests and fines. What’s worse is that Telegram, one of the main chat-based apps used in Russia, is vulnerable to these searches. Even just having the Telegram app on a personal device might imply that its owner doesn’t support the Kremlin’s war. But the builders of Telegram have failed to design the app with considerations for personal safety in high-risk environments, and not just in the Russian context. Telegram can thus be weaponized against its users.Likewise, amid the back and forth about Elon Musk’s plan to buy Twitter, many people who use the platform have expressed concerns over his bid to forefront algorithmic content moderation and other design changes on the whim of his $44 billion fancy. Bringing in recommendations from someone with no framework of risk and harms to highly marginalized people leads to proclamations of “authenticating all humans.” This seems to be a push to remove online anonymity, something I’ve written about very personally. It is ill-thought-through, harmful to those most at risk, and backed by no actual methodology or evidence. Beyond his unclear outbursts for changes, Musk’s previous actions combined with the existing harms from Twitter’s current structures have made it clear that we’re heading toward further impacts on marginalized groups, such as Black and POC Twitter users and trans folks. Meanwhile, lack of safety infrastructure is hitting home hard in the US since the leak of the draft Supreme Court’s opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson showing that protections provided under Roe v. Wade are mortally under threat. With the projected criminalization of those seeking or providing abortion services, it has become more and more apparent that the tools and technologies most used for accessing vital health care data are insecure and dangerous.The same steps could protect users in all these contexts. If the builders of these tools had designed their apps by focusing on safety in high-risk environments—for persons who are often seen as the more “extreme” or “edge” cases and therefore ignored—the weaponization that users fear would not be possible, or at the very least they would have tools to manage their risk.The reality is that making better, safer, less harmful tech requires design based on the lived realities of those who are most marginalized. These “edge cases” are frequently ignored as being outside of the scope of a typical user’s likely experiences. Yet they are powerful indicators for understanding the flaws in our technologies.This is why I refer to these cases—of people, groups, and communities who are the most impacted and least supported—as “decentered.” The decentered are the most marginalized and often most criminalized. By understanding and establishing who is most impacted by distinct social, political, and legal frameworks, we can understand who would most likely be a victim of the weaponization of certain technologies. And, as an added benefit, technology which has recentered the extremes will always be generalizable to the broader usership. SUBSCRIBESubscribe to WIRED and stay smart with more of your favorite Ideas writers.From 2016 to early this year, I led a research project at the human rights organization Article 19 in conjunction with local organizations in Iran, Lebanon, and Egypt, with support from international experts. We explored the lived experiences of queer persons who faced police persecution as a result of using specific personal technologies. Take the experience of a queer Syrian refugee in Lebanon who was stopped at a police or army check point for papers. They had their phone arbitrarily searched. The icon for a queer app, Grindr, is seen, and the officer determines the person is queer. Other areas of the refugee’s phone are then checked, revealing what is deemed as “queer content.” The refugee is taken in for further interrogation and subjected to verbal and physical abuse. They now face sentencing under Article 534 of the Lebanese Penal Code and face potential imprisonment, fines, and/or revocation of their immigration status in Lebanon. This is one case among many.But what if this logo was hidden, and an app indicating an individual’s sexuality was not readily available to them? While still letting the individual keep the app and connection to other queer people? Based on the research and collaboration with the Guardian Project, Grindr worked to implement a stealth mode on its product.The company also implemented our other recommendations with similar success. Changes such as the Discreet App Icon allowed users to have the app appear as a common utility, such as a calendar or calculator. So, in an initial police search, users can bypass that risk of being outed by the content or visuals of the apps they own. While this feature was created solely based on the outcomes of extreme cases, such as the queer Syrian refugee, it proved popular with users globally. Indeed, it became so popular that it went from being fully available only in “high risk” countries to being available internationally for free in 2020, along with the popular PIN feature that was also introduced under this project. This was the first time a dating app took such radical security measures for its users; many of Grindr’s competitors followed suit.After the success of the Discreet App Icon, and based on the recommendations from the project, Grindr introduced a variety of new features—such as unsending messages, ephemeral photos, screenshot blocking, and contextualized safety guides—in late 2019 and 2020, and focused on harm reduction for all users. These changes are now utilized by users worldwide, from New York to São Paulo, Brazil. Earlier this year, WhatsApp adopted changes for its 2 billion users that centered the harm faced by the queer community in the Middle East and North Africa. These changes are based on my recent report documenting the use of digital evidence against LGBTQ people in Tunisia, Lebanon, and Egypt. Both companies report that these changes caused a positive shift in user engagement with these features specifically, as well as with the app as a whole.These are all examples of what I call designing from the margins, or how building new communication technologies needs to be done by directly centering highly marginalized and criminalized communities. (My report—Design From The Margins: Centering the Most Marginalized and Impacted in Design Processes, From Ideation to Production*—*has just been published.) We need to radically shift how we are building our technologies if we have any chance at mitigating further harms.Going back to Telegram, Elon Musk’s Twitter plans, and the impending threats to abortion access and safety: If these apps’ security protocols were learning from experiences of decentered people in highly policed and risky contexts, Telegram could have had discreet app icons to avoid it from being an admission of guilt in the eyes of the Russian police, or it could have implemented a more robust disappearing-messages structure that could protect against device checks. It also could have built safer channels to avoid threats to administrators in high risk contexts (as Telegram could have learned from incidents in Iran).Likewise, if Twitter understood the risks faced by communities living under surveillance and built products for them, it would have moved to encrypting DMs end-to-end, which would prevent Musk (or anyone else within Twitter) from having easy access (especially with increasing concerns due to Musk’s worrisome partnerships). But as of today, that technology has not been rolled out, and it’s impossible to truly delete DMs.As with Musk’s vague nods at quashing anonymity: If Twitter had learned from groups and communities who have to remain anonymous to exist, it would have pushed for more nuanced, practical, and less data-invasive strategies to protect against fake profiles while also protecting vulnerable people from privacy breaches, especially those who live under dictatorships. Take the learnings from Egypt: We know Egyptian police use fake online profiles to entrap and arrest queer people and use what is found on their phones as evidence in court. Yet most queer people in a context where their identity is criminalized need to remain anonymous while connecting online. Their ask is for companies to better detect entrapers without creating more risks for the community’s safety: It’s the imperative of companies and experts to find this middle ground without squashing those most impacted. Progress on this can be made only when companies center experiences that highlight gaps in designs from all angles.As for Dobbs v. Jackson: In 2021, the Digital Defence Fund outlined the needed steps for online safety for folks to avoid putting themselves at risk with a trove of digital footprints when seeking abortion support. Experts have rightly pointed out that the major threat isn’t solely data collection via period-tracking apps, but also fake clinics and police device searches. And those who will be most impacted are, of course, communities of color, LGBTQ people, sex workers, and highly disenfranchised communities. If the tools had been built with their cases in mind, with some foresight of the risks and their weaponization, they could have avoided a mass exodus of users (as we’re seeing with period-tracking apps) but also remained as go-to resources in a time of dire need. These shifts and changes could protect those who need it most in such a turbulent time, and also make the tools pioneers among their competitors.No small fixes can address the larger and deeply rooted structural issues that foreground how these technologies are deployed or weaponized. However, in centering, consulting, and understanding the legal, social, and political issues that impact decentered and marginalized groups, some protections can be provided. Reimagining the importance of cases that deviate from the so-called typical technology user and placing them at the center of the design process is not a revolutionary concept. It's a core basis for many industries. In terms of safety and security, it should be seen as a corporate responsibility in developing tech. As one of the Tunisian lawyers from the Digital Crime Scenes report frames it. “We are in your application, you must protect us,” and when you do, you’re protecting all of us. It is no longer advisable to design technologies without designing directly for those who are most harmed. In fact, technology is better, safer, more innovative, more robust, and more integrative of privacy when those most marginalized are centered from the start of the development process. So the question isn’t can it be done, but rather why isn’t it being done?\n\n|| Summary ||\n\n, risks and harms to highly marginalized people leads to proclamations of “authenticating all humans”. Bringing in recommendations from someone with no framework of risk leads to proclamations of “authenticating all humans”. lack of safety infrastructure is hitting home hard in the US since the leak of the draft Supreme Court’s opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson.\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='dexigner'></a>\n# Dexigner","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def ws_dexigner(news_cards, data, st_dict):\n    print('||| Beginning Web Scraping |||')\n    try:\n        for news in tqdm(news_cards):\n            link = ws.get_elements(news, 3, \".//a\", False).get_attribute('href')\n            wd = ws.get_wd(link)\n            article = ws.get_elements(wd, 1, \"article-body\", False)\n            article = ''.join(article.text.split('\\n'))\n            wd.quit()\n#             print(article)\n#             print(link)\n    \n            headline = ws.get_elements(news, 3, \".//h3\", False).text\n#             print(headline)\n    \n            subline = ws.get_elements(news, 3, \".//p\", False).text\n#             print(subline)\n    \n            date = ws.get_elements(news, 3, \".//time\", False).get_attribute('datetime')\n            date = datetime.strptime(date, '%Y-%m-%d').date()          \n#             print(date)\n\n            data['link'].append(link)\n            data['headline'].append(headline)\n            data['subline'].append(subline)\n            data['date'].append(date)\n            data['article'].append(article)\n        print(\"||| Tabulation Complete. |||\")\n            \n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Unable to ws_dexigner() due to {e}\")\n    \n    return data","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-06-22T16:40:31.027774Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-06-22T16:40:31.028427Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-06-22T16:40:31.038585Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-06-22T16:40:31.028389Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-06-22T16:40:31.037450Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":11,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"url = \"https://www.dexigner.com\"\nsname = \"item\" #class\nwd = ws.get_wd(url)\n\nnews_cards = ws.get_elements(wd, 0, sname)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-06-22T16:40:31.039995Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-06-22T16:40:31.040368Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-06-22T16:40:33.436462Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-06-22T16:40:31.040332Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-06-22T16:40:33.435369Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":12,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"datanames = ['subline', 'link', 'headline', 'date', 'article', 'summary']\ndf_dexigner = ws.webscrap(sitename=\"dexigner\", sitefunction=ws_dexigner, datanames=datanames, news_cards=news_cards)\nwd.quit()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-06-22T16:40:33.439179Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-06-22T16:40:33.440017Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-06-22T16:42:49.519703Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-06-22T16:40:33.439956Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-06-22T16:42:49.518609Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":13,"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"  0%|          | 0/29 [00:00<?, ?it/s]","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stdout","text":"||| Beginning Web Scraping |||\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stderr","text":"100%|██████████| 29/29 [00:54<00:00,  1.88s/it]\n  0%|          | 0/29 [00:00<?, ?it/s]","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stdout","text":"||| Tabulation Complete. |||\n||| Web Scraping Complete for DEXIGNER. |||\n||| Generating Summaries... |||\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stderr","text":"100%|██████████| 29/29 [01:21<00:00,  2.81s/it]","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stdout","text":"||| Articles Summarized. |||\n||| Creating Dataframe, Saving as CSV |||\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stderr","text":"\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df_dexigner.sample(5)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-06-22T16:42:49.521505Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-06-22T16:42:49.521835Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-06-22T16:42:49.538132Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-06-22T16:42:49.521799Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-06-22T16:42:49.537011Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":14,"outputs":[{"execution_count":14,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"                                              subline  \\\n19  The Butrint National Park Visitor Center Inter...   \n12  The Ceramics of Italy Tile Competition -

Article ||\n\nScandinavian studios Henning Larsen and White Arkitekter are designing Stockholm Wood City, which will become the world's largest mass-timber development and have the \"serenity of a forest\".Set to be built in the Stockholm neighbourhood of Sickla, the project was dubbed the \"world's largest wooden city\" by developer Atrium Ljungberg as it will use more timber that any other project in development.Stockholm Wood City, which will have 7,000 office spaces and 2,000 homes and cover 250,000 square metres, is being designed by Danish studio Henning Larsen and Swedish firm White Arkitekter.According to the developer, the district will feature nature-informed elements and was designed to have the feel of a forest.\"We sought to create an urban environment infused with the serenity of a forest, resulting in a dense, open space that bears the distinctively minimalistic and functional aesthetic of Scandinavian design,\" Atrium Ljungberg told Dezeen.\"The architects innovatively incorporated natural elements into the structures – for instance, green roofs for better insulation and large windows to let in natural light, embodying our vision of a city that thrives in harmony with nature,\" it added.The buildings will be constructed from fire-proofed mass timber.\"Engineered wood forms a protective char layer on the surface that retains much of its structural strength, contributing to a safer structure,\" the developer said.As well as being made from wood, a material that both sequesters carbon and emits fewer emissions than concrete, there are other benefits in building cities from wood, it added.\"Wooden construction means significantly reduced climate impact both during the construction phase and through the whole life cycle,\" Atrium Ljungberg said.\"Research has also proven other strong benefits, such as improved well-being for people and a faster, quieter construction process.\"Stockholm Wood City will also have self-produced, stored and shared energy, according to the developer, which didn't reveal the details of the project's energy production.The development will break ground in 2025, with the first buildings set to be completed in 2027.\"We are building the project in phases to learn new things during each phase which we can then apply in the following phases,\" the developer said.\"We will learn much more from doing this at such a big scale. Our core strategy is to develop large interconnected areas,\" it added.\"In this way, we can create places full of variety that people enjoy and where they want to be, as opposed to just setting up a single building.\"As well as homes and workplaces, Stockholm Wood City will also have restaurants and shops.The project is the latest in a row of large wooden projects that are currently under construction, including a Toronto waterfront project that will feature designs by Adjaye Architects, Alison Brooks Architects and Henning Larsen.White Arkitekter also designed Sara Kulturhus, a 20-storey mass-timber cultural building in northern Sweden that we took a closer look at as part of our Timber Revolution series.The visuals are courtesy of Henning Larsen and White Arkitekter.\n\n|| Summary ||\n\n, the \"world's largest wooden city\" is being designed by Danish studio Henning Larsen and Swedish firm White Arkitekter.

MotherDuck itself likens DuckDB to “SQLite for analytics workloads.”Image Credits: MotherDuckImage Credits: MotherDuck“As nearly every organization, large and small, strives to figure out how to get value out of their data, scale becomes much less interesting than making it easy to derive insights. While today is a momentous day for our company, it is just a first flap of our wings on this journey,” said MotherDuck CEO Tigani. “We’re confident that the combined innovation between MotherDuck’s platform and DuckDB Labs’s database will be a critical piece of how the modern data stack evolves over the next few years. Ultimately, we’re proud to be able to deliver on our vision to bring the power of DuckDB to more people. And of course to make analytics ducking awesome.”MotherDuck is obviously treading a well-worn path here. Launching a SaaS-based version of an open-source project is, after all, the current default to monetize these tools. The company is launching its platform at the right time, though. Even companies that aren’t focusing their data strategies on AI are increasingly aware of the value of operationalizing their data and while many of the existing tools focus on big data use cases, DuckDB — and MotherDuck’s serverless offering — also cater to small and medium businesses.The MotherDuck team stresses that this new offering also makes it easier for users whose data is already in the cloud to move to DuckDB. \n\n|| Summary ||\n\nto monetize these tools.

What is surprising, though, is that the TV is even cheaper than it was in May less than a month later.Right now, you can buy LG’s 55-inch C3 OLED at an all-time low of around $1,497 ($403 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and direct from LG. Both larger and smaller sizes are on sale as well, including the 48-inch configuration, which is available for a new low of $1,249.99 ($250 off) from Best Buy and LG.In a nutshell, LG’s new C3 boasts the kind of impressive black levels, vivid colors, and rich contrast that have come to characterize OLED TVs in recent years. It also features a number of other welcome features, including support for Dolby Vision, AMD FreeSync, Nvidia G-Sync, and a speedy 120Hz refresh rate that gamers will surely appreciate. Plus, it features several new picture modes and more processing power than LG’s last-gen C2, which it owes to LG’s new α9 AI Processor Gen6 chip.The LG C3 is similar to its last-gen predecessor, the C2, but offers more processing power and new picture modes. Both 4K TVs sport a 120Hz refresh rate and low input lag, along with support for Nvidia G-Sync and AMD FreeSync variable refresh rate tech.If you need a new USB-C charger, Anker’s 30W 511 Charger is on sale at Amazon in a range of colors for $18.39 instead of $22.99, which is the charger’s lowest price to date. It’s also on sale direct from Anker for $18.99 when you use promo code WS7DYTEJPQ at checkout.Don’t be fooled by its small size: Anker’s miniature wall charger is capable of charging a number of devices, including your smartphone, tablet, and other electronics. It’s also smaller than Apple’s own 30W USB-C charger so you can slip it into your purse or pocket without a problem, and it comes with a two-year warranty for extra peace of mind.Anker’s 30W 511 Charger can top off a phone rather quickly but remains small enough to fit in a small bag or purse.Sure, there’s now a larger 15-inch MacBook Air in town, but if you crave even more space, you might want to look at the LG Gram 17. Right now, the latest model is on sale at Best Buy for an all-time low of $1,199.99 ($600 off) when you buy it with 16GB of RAM, 1TB of storage, and a 12th Gen Intel Core i7-1260P processor.

The exhibition traces these themes of sustainability and anticipation of the future:\"The birth of the practice in the 1960s coincided with the first signs of an awareness of the fragility of the planet. These were the green shoots of what would later be named The Green Movement,\" explains Foster.\"These principles may now be mainstream, but more than half a century ago, they were revolutionary and anticipated the reality of today. Throughout the decades, we have sought to challenge conventions, reinvent building types and demonstrate an architecture of light and lightness, inspired by nature, which can be about joy as well as being eco-friendly.\"A post shared by Centre Pompidou (@centrepompidou)The exhibition runs until August 7, 2023, and is organised by the Centre Pompidou, with the participation of Foster + Partners

It has an extremely recognisable colour scheme, those Golden Arches and the courage to create playful marketing campaigns that sometimes don't even mention its product.But which are the best McDonald's adverts ever? There are a lot to choose from, from drunken McDonald's messages to an ingenious campaign in France where doors were made to look like fries. One user on Twitter has rounded up what he thinks are the best ones ever, and we've highlighted a few below. Did your favourite make the cut?In the number one spot is this ad for chicken nuggets, which is a simple idea, executed well. It shows the product, and riffs on the cravings people have for said chicken nugget. And the ketchup plus nugget is a subtle nod to the McDonald's colours. (See our why McDonald's uses red and yellow post for more about the brand's colour palette.)At number two, there's a father's day ad, which shows a cup holding hands with two smaller cups. I don't think it has quite the elegance of the nugget, but it's still a clever idea.In third spot is this 'open 24 hours' ad, which shows a burger half in darkness. Again, this is a simple idea. @TheChiefPlug captions it with: \"Principle: Turn every boring announcement into an excuse to be creative.\" And we couldn't have put it better ourselves.Skipping further down the list is this iconic campaign from the 1960s, which declares 'look for the golden arches'! This works well because the arches are so easy to identify, and as a slogan it's also memorable.To explore more McDonald's ads,  and see if your favcourite made the cut, see the thread here. And while you're at it, don't miss our piece on the ingenious TableBag.\n\n|| Summary ||\n\n, and it's a clever idea.: Turn every boring announcement into an excuse to be creative.:: Turn every boring announcement into an excuse to be creative.::ss,s ands, and the courage to create playful marketing campaigns that sometimes don't mention its product.But which are the best McDonald's adverts ever?

Palaces present an ideal location for couples aiming to cast all notions of humility aside on such a momentous occasion in favor of some real pomp and circumstance. The majestic structures are the stuff of real-life fairytales, where royal titleholders like the Windsors—and de facto royals, like Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas—have gotten hitched in the company of hundreds of their closest friends and relatives. Throwing a party inside of towering stone walls with centuries-old battlements or among ornate banquet halls with high-vaulted ceilings is a surefire way to give guests an experience they’ll never forget. While the term royal wedding may have established some very Great Britain–specific associations in recent years, there are a number of luxe castle properties functioning as wedding venues all across the globe, from Italy’s Lazio region to Long Island, New York. For couples hoping to hold court like kings and queens and host a big day with a capital B, read on for a selection of some of the most lavish castle wedding venues around the world.\n\n|| Summary ||\n\ns are the stuff of real-life fairytales, where royal titleholders like the Windsors—and de facto royals, like Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas—have gotten hitched in the company of hundreds of their closest friends and relatives. palaces are the stuff of real-life fairytales, where royal titleholders like the Windsors—and de facto royals, like Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas—have gotten hitched in the\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df_architecturaldigest.sample(5)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-06-22T17:26:04.056908Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-06-22T17:26:04.057299Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-06-22T17:26:04.082054Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-06-22T17:26:04.057263Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-06-22T17:26:04.080855Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":55,"outputs":[{"execution_count":55,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"                 topic                                               link  \\\n2             magazine  https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/in...   \n6               travel  https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/it...   \n3               travel  https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/wo...   \n9  culture + lifestyle  https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/op...   \n5    innovative design  https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/mo...   \n\n                                            headline  \\\n2  Step Inside a Jeremiah Brent and William Hefne...   \n6           9 Italian Islands Only Locals Know About   \n3  The World’s 11 Most Famous Artist Homes That Y...   \n9   9 Opulent Castle Wedding Venues Around the World   \n5           10 Most Beautifully Repurposed Buildings   \n\n                                             subline             author  \\\n2  A young family enlisted their two design crush...

Article ||\n\nPixar’s Elemental debuted over the weekend with the second-lowest three-day opening – for a wide release – in studio history at an estimated $29.5 million while Warner Bros.’s latest cg-heavy DC hero flick bombed with just $55.1 million grossed over the frame.The only Pixar film to ever make less than Elemental over a three-day opening was the original Toy Story, which made $29.1 million over its first three-day weekend. The debuts of the two films cannot really be compared, however, and Elemental being second-worst is merely a technicality. There is simply no historical precedent for a Pixar film opening as poorly as Elemental.Toy Story, for starters, opened on a Wednesday, so it had already made $9.9m before its $29.1m weekend. It also played in 1,500 fewer theaters than Elemental. And Toy Story opened multiple generations ago, in 1995, when the average U.S. movie ticket price was less than half of what it is today. Adjusted for inflation, Toy Story’s three-day weekend gross would be closer to $57 million today.Peter Sohn’s Elemental vs Andrés Muschietti’s The Flash was meant to be the box office battle that kicked off this summer’s theatrical season. Instead, the two films fell flat, failing to hit even their most modest predictions that had been lowered several times in recent weeks.Domestic box office prognosticators had The Flash tagged to debut at around $70 million and Elemental at $35 million. Those figures would have been seen as failures for either film. The fact that neither even came close is a disaster. According to The New York Times, both films had budgets exceeding $200 million.Things weren’t any better abroad, with Elemental only making $15 million from 17 markets and The Flash pulling in $75 million from 78 markets. With fairly weak competition, that meant The Flash finished first at the global box office, followed by Transformers: Rise of the Beasts, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, and Elemental in fourth.It’s fair to say that Elemental has been the biggest bust in Pixar’s history, but it’s also important to look at the circumstances that led to this point. By most accounts, Elemental isn’t a bad film. Critics have mostly liked or at least tolerated it, and audiences have generally enjoyed it. Elemental has an A Cinemascore, a 92% Rotten Tomatoes audience score, and strong Postrak results with 85% of those polled giving it a positive score and 68% saying they would recommend the film to others.So why did Elemental bomb so badly? Although the film’s recent reviews have been mostly positive, the film bombed with critics at its Cannes debut. More recent reviews have been far more enthusiastic about the film, but you never get a second chance at a first impression, and Elemental was introduced to the world as a dud at its high-profile French Riviera debut.There is also almost definitely some truth to the theory that Disney’s streaming-heavy distribution plans in recent years have caused severe damage to the theatrical prospects of its family-focused films. After sending title after title straight to Disney+ during and after the worst of the pandemic, short theatrical windows for many of its features since then have conditioned parents to save time and money by waiting for films to hit Disney+.It’s also almost certainly true that Pixar’s brand has been damaged. After years of no Pixar theatrical releases, Lightyear failed to launch with audiences and Disney’s Strange World probably caused some collateral damage as well.Making matters worse for the company’s distribution wing, Disney’s remakes have been struggling too. The Little Mermaid only managed to splash up $11.6 million domestically and $15.3 million internationally over the weekend, its fourth in theaters.Disney needs to hit it out of the park with Wish later this year. It’s still way too early to predict how that film will perform, or if it will be any good, but reactions after last week’s Annecy first look were favorable and there is a bit of buzz building around the film.It wasn’t all bad news at the Father’s Day weekend box office for animated films. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse was third domestically and globally, pulling in $27.8 million at home and $27.6 million abroad. The film’s domestic cume now sits at $280 million and its international at $209 million, putting the latest Spider-flick just short of the half-billion mark at $489 million grossed.\n\n|| Summary ||\n\n, Elemental debuts at around $70 million and Elemental at $35 million.
