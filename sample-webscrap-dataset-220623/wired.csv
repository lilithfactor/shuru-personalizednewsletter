But the era of corporate greenwashing has transformed LEED into a badge of status. Recent constructions Apple Park, Google Bay View, and Salesforce Tower all boast LEED Platinum medallions.

Read more here.Yet despite those innovations, the most sustainable building projects do not start from scratch. Reworking the old, unloved, and unsophisticated—even ugly—buildings that populate most of the urban landscape has more power to meaningfully reduce carbon emissions, waste, and pollution from the built environment. While buildings still stand, they embody all of the carbon and energy expended in their construction. “Even if you were to replace an old building with a brand-new, highly efficient building, it could take anywhere from 50-80 years to offset that building impact,” says Ian Zapata, global lead for building transformation and adaptive reuse at architecture firm Gensler.Urban RethinkMajor renovations can require 50 to 75 percent of the carbon emissions of new construction, Zapata says. That makes the most sustainable building one that already exists—and there are plenty available right now. The crisis in the office real estate market triggered by the US work-from-home shift has led many cities to incentivize adaptive reuse, the renovation of existing structures into new buildings with different purposes. One of the most popular versions of this is converting offices to housing in places where downtowns have become ghost towns.  Adaptive reuse is not always easy, cheap, or popular, and it may be hard to convert the existing office stock into suitable housing, says Uwe Brandes, director of the urban and regional planning program at Georgetown University. A concrete office block is difficult to break into apartments with windows; conversely, a two-story strip mall poses serious challenges to a company looking for an office tower. But there might be little else to do with these structures that have been partially or mostly abandoned. Tearing them down completely would be worse financially and for the planet. “People have to accept that they are going to have to lose money in order to retain some value,” Brandes says. “That’s a very uncomfortable conversation.”The most sustainable building projects do not start from scratchIf city planners and real estate owners can work through that conversation, adaptive reuse is a massive win for the climate. The emissions associated with the creation and disposal of materials inside existing structures are known in the trade as embodied carbon.For a sense of scale, the global built environment contributes to about 40 percent of global carbon emissions, with about a quarter of that embodied carbon. The World Green Building Council estimates that the world’s stock of buildings will double in size to accommodate population growth between 2020 and 2040. Without some drastic increase in adaptive reuse, that means a huge spike in carbon released from destroying old buildings and reproducing them with new ones.For any existing structure, the core materials—mostly concrete in the foundation, steel in support beams, and wood in floorboards—required carbon emissions to create, shape, transport, and assemble. Wood elements also physically store carbon captured by the trees when they were alive. Ripping down an existing structure means wasting all the energy that went into the creation of its materials. The destruction itself also requires energy, and the waste materials must be moved to landfills. Add that to the energy and emissions required to make, transport, and assemble materials for a brand-new building, and it’s easy to see how making use of what has already been built is the more environmentally sustainable option. Susan Piedmont-Palladino, director of the Washington-Alexandria Architecture Center at Virginia Tech, spoke to WIRED from inside an office building that embodies this premise. It was built in 1909 as an all-girls elementary school. “It’s a brick building, but the floor structure is all lumber that would have been cut down in the early 20th century,” she says. “Here I sit in this building with that carbon locked up and useful. If we were to demolish it, all of this stuff has to go to a landfill or reclamation.”Material SavingsIt’s now possible to quantify the metric tons of carbon that can be saved by not rebuilding from scratch, which can help persuade clients or planners to take the greener option. Most architecture and engineering firms now have access to software such as OneClick LCA or EC3 that can simulate scenarios for reusing existing materials and structures in a new project. This software can also be used to assess the financial value of old foundations, concrete, aluminum, wood, and other material and plan how to incorporate pieces of existing structure. If a structure cannot be saved, sometimes the materials can be reused—one type of concrete can be broken down and made into a different style of concrete, for example.“This is approaching common practice,” says Christopher Pyke, a senior vice president at the US Green Building Council and an urban planning professor at Georgetown university. “It’s been a foundational part of the LEED rating system for the last five years, and in Europe it’s being codified in regulation.” LEED plaques on shiny new buildings can now reflect that not everything about a new construction is new or that the structure has been entirely repurposed from an old building.One concept embraced by some European architects views buildings themselves as material banks—structures that store and save materials for future use. Some buildings are being designed to be easier to demolish in the future so the materials can be easily accessed for new projects. Piedmont-Palladino, though intrigued by materials banking, is more compelled by the inverse idea—building for long-lasting but adaptable permanence. Making architecture more sustainable requires changing people’s mindset, she says, and resisting the allure of shiny green baubles.“Architecture has been really quick to tear it down and make it new. The more people associate architecture with trends and with fashion, the more dangerous it gets. Same thing with urban design,” she says. “You are not the last people who are going to be involved with this building.”Take the final project of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe,  who is one of the most important architects of the 20th century but is fading from popularity. He created a modern, minimalist, “skin and bones” style that shaped American urban landscapes in the last 25 years of the 20th century. The Martin Luther King Jr. Library in Washington, DC, one of his final projects, was not completed until three years after he died, in 1972. “It went through the stock market crash of reputation. Everyone loved it and then everyone hated it,” Piedmont-Palladino says. By the early 2000s, the library was neglected and reviled by borrowers  and librarians for its dark, cramped, and unusable spaces. When the library system finally requested proposals for a renovation, many in DC called for it to be demolished and rebuilt from scratch. Piedmont-Palladino, on the selection committee for new architects for the project, was one of many who objected, on the grounds of both sustainability and aesthetics. “Mies, he’s hard to love. But were we really going to demolish this project that represented modernism coming to Washington?” In the end, they didn’t. The library, which reopened in late 2020, looks shiny and new. The architects added wood, curves, windows, and sound, making the place warm and beautiful rather than austere and intimidating. But the structure retained its Mies’ facade, its history—and its embodied carbon.",",, and you will find hymns to biophilic properties that encourage plants to grow on a building, water recycling systems, and transparent photovoltaic glass.

Retro aesthetics aside, Teenage Engineering’s gizmos are known for being absolutely stuffed with modern features. The TP-7 is no different. For starters, it has an accompanying transcription mode when synced to an iOS app, so your voice recordings can be converted to text.The device is meant to nestle into the palm of your hand, so there’s a rocker along the side where your index and ring fingers would naturally rest. Pressing that rocker switch one way or the other lets you fast-forward or reverse the audio playback. Yes, that disc in the center smoothly spins like a tape reel while the TP-7 is playing or recording. The movement is mostly for show (it’s all digital; there’s no actual tape in there), but the wheel can be used to scrub through the audio by spinning it quickly or to pause the recording by grabbing it and stopping its movement. Unnecessary? Yes. Cool? Well, yeah. It’s got seven hours of battery life and 128 gigabytes of internal storage for all your audio keepsakes.Cool as it looks and likely feels, it may not be the best choice for your audio recording needs. The TP-7 doesn’t have an XLR input, the connector type that is a standard in many professional mics and other audio equipment. There is an internal mic built into the TP-7, of course, along with three 3.5-mm inputs that will take a typical aux cord. There’s also a 6.35-mm output that you can use to connect the recorder to fancy headphones or speakers. It’s also much, much more expensive than one of the standard audio recorders sold by industry leaders like Tascam or Zoom. The TP-7 is going for—record scratch—$1,500. The company says it will be released sometime this summer.Read on for more gadget news.iPad Music and VideoIn other audio production news, Apple is sticking its formerly desktop-only software Logic Pro and Final Cut Pro on the iPad. The iPad has carved out a nice little niche for itself in the beat-making business with a rich library of music creation apps, so getting the digital audio workstation Logic on there makes a ton of sense.Apple is making its Final Cut Pro video editing software available for the device as well. Both software suites have new controls and features that take advantage of the iPad’s touchscreen. You can use multitouch to stretch and move clips around, or change pitch and other audio settings in Logic. Both programs allow exporting to their respective desktop counterparts.Each program is available as a subscription service for $5 per month or $50 per year.Amazon Anywhere All at OnceIf you ever felt like it’s just not easy enough to impulse-buy from Amazon, good news: The retailer has a new service that lets you buy stuff while playing games. Called Amazon Anywhere, it’s a service that can be embedded in partner apps and virtual services to better enable you to quickly buy things in real life.The first game to work with Amazon Anywhere is Peridot, by Pokemon Go creator Niantic. The game tasks you with caring for and bonding with augmented reality critters projected in the real world. (Think Pokemon Go meets Tamagotchi.) The way the payments work is that you sync your Amazon account in the game, which will then allow you to spend real money to buy physical merch with your imaginary animals printed on it.In other Amazon-shopping-tech news, the company has expanded a recent TikTok-like feed where influencers and brands peddle their goods in short videos.

gear,https://www.wired.com/story/construction-waste-circular-building-deconstruction/,"Hey Man, Can I Use That Building When You’re Done With It?",Nicole Gull Mcelroy,"“Those buildings don’t get used after the four weeks of the Olympics and Paraolympics,” says California-based architect Rob Berry. “They become obsolete. We are thinking about how buildings are made and really looking at it.”But when the Olympics are over and everyone goes home, those new buildings—sports venues, athlete dorms, restrooms, souvenir shops, restaurants, and concession stands—will sit empty. Looming over the Olympics’ afterlife is the substantial and somewhat tricky question of what the event’s planning team will do with them.“Those buildings don’t get used after the four weeks of the Olympics and Paraolympics,” says California-based architect Rob Berry. “They become obsolete. We are thinking about how buildings are made and really looking at it.”Berry is an assistant professor at the University of Southern California School of Architecture and principal at Los Angeles-based firm Berry and Linné. He says the setup presents an incredible opportunity to explore some very big questions about the stream of construction waste generated every year. To make that point, the students in his second-year undergraduate studio are hard at work on a project he’s calling Making LA. It focuses on designing structures for the LA 2028 Olympics that can transform, disappear, or begin a second life after the spectacle is over.A few of the ideas the USC students have dreamed up include a concession stand that can be disassembled and recycled or reused after the games for a different purpose and a media center that can be transformed into a public library. The project is part theory, part design exercise, as Berry hasn’t been in touch with the LA28 planning committee … yet.“I have discussed the studio with USC’s Office of Sustainability, and next spring we will likely involve members of the USC community that are involved in preparing USC’s facilities for the Olympics,” he says. “It’s more of an academic exercise the first go-around, but larger engagement will be emphasized more as I refine the brief.” Still, Making LA is very much rooted in reality: answering some perplexing and pressing questions about the future of architecture, construction, and building design. “How would a building work on day one?” asks Berry. “And what also happens in five years and 10 years when it’s outdated and its intended use has changed, not just becoming waste?”Exploring CircularityGlobally, the construction industry creates about one-third of the world’s waste. The Environmental Protection Agency estimated in 2018 that 600 million tons of construction and demolition waste is generated every year in the US alone. The related implications of these two stats are not only material (trash headed for landfills), but also environmental (carbon emissions, air quality, noise pollution). And as architects, contractors, designers, and policy makers unpack the issue, Making LA is part of a burgeoning focus on what’s called circular building—the practice of making buildings that can be more easily disassembled, moved, or repurposed. It also places a strong emphasis on materials that can be reused instead of ending up in a landfill.A few recent examples of the approach in action include a waterfront Copenhagen bar and restaurant built for eventual relocation; Philadelphia architecture firm Kieran Timberlake’s innovative prefab, sustainable homes Loblolly House and Cellophane House; a 3D-printed home made entirely from forest materials at the University of Maine; and a timber frame office building in Oslo. Startups are fueling a shift toward circular building too: Rheaply is a Chicago-based resource exchange platform built to help companies and organizations reuse materials so they can reach sustainability goals, while Rotor Deconstruction is a Brussels-based co-op that dismantles, organizes, and trades salvaged parts of buildings.While circular construction and design for disassembly is often practiced on a smaller scale, many architects and designers are pushing the idea forward and testing the limits of what’s possible with larger projects.Charles Sharpless and Jessica Colangelo say their architecture and design practice, Somewhere Studio, bridges their professional interests with the work they’re doing as faculty teaching interior design and architecture (respectively) at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville. The pair’s approach has come in the form of what they’re calling temporary pavilions, structures designed and hand-built entirely from materials used during construction that often get tossed once the project is complete. The buildings are assembled from things like scrap shoring (wood used to support structures during construction) and offcut lumber (scraps of wood that remain after cutting a larger piece). These structures are designed in a way that allows them to be assembled, disassembled, moved, and reassembled in a new location for any period of time.The projects are located in public spaces, where they are meant to provide shade or shelter—think bus stops or picnic pavilions. Some invite human interaction with their installed swings, benches, or even cell phone charging stations. “We’ve found it to be a valuable way to learn about the challenges and opportunities inherent in this approach, as well as a way to engage our students and the general public in thinking about the issue,” says Colangelo.The duo’s most recent project to that end, called Mix and Match, was installed at the University of Virginia’s Biomaterial Building Exposition in 2022. The goal, says Sharpless, was to better understand the use of “the ubiquitous byproducts” of the building process to decrease waste. Colangelo is quick to point out that this work is very experimental and isn’t yet ready for large-scale projects. But it does begin to suggest what might be possible with more research and experimentation.Leveraging repurposed material, Colangelo says, depends largely on what’s available at the time. Considerations such as dimensions and joint tolerance also matter and are contingent on well-timed, available resources, says Sharpless. “It’s driving an interest,” says Colangelo. With their work, Colangelo and Sharpless aim to influence the design process and answer questions like What does efficiency look like? How can we use fewer materials and create less waste? How can we do all of that while building something that’s both beautiful and useful?Large-Scale WorkFor Ona Flindall, CEO of Norwegian architecture firm Oslotre AS, timber frame construction has proven a reliable way to design a building for disassembly and lessen its ecological impact. Her firm recently completed an entirely timber frame office building in Oslo, called the HasleTre Project, which now holds the offices for Save the Children. The building is undeniably beautiful and was the firm’s third (and most sophisticated) effort of this kind.“We see the material choice of timber as a key driver in the industry,” she says. “It’s a ‘Sustainability 101’ answer. This is the easy way out; the dummies solution and a starting block.” For HasleTre, Flindall’s firm teamed up with an ambitious developer that aimed to substantially reduce the project’s carbon footprint, and even went so far as to create a “guide for disassembly” to be used once the building’s life ends. While timber stores CO2 for the lifespan of the building, according to government and industry researchers, only 6 percent of timber waste is recycled.Dan Stine is director of Design Technology at Lake Flato Architects in San Antonio, Texas, which has designed a few mass timber projects across the country. Part of his job is running the firm’s internal research program. He points out that timber is a great solution for making a building that can be more easily disassembled, but it still presents some unanswered questions. “One idea we are looking at is the end-of-life implications for mass timber in terms of the carbon sequestration,” he says. “What happens at the end of the life of that mass timber project?”Flindall says the architects on her firm’s project looked deeply at climate concerns, as well as material scarcity, and ultimately arrived at a design that used as much timber as possible with optimal opportunity for reuse in the future. “If the value of the structure can be retained for the building’s owner, then this shifts the view of construction as a one-time-investment to that of a material bank account for the future,” she says. “An investment. This, we hope, will mean that there is a renewed appreciation for high-quality materials for a long life and a secondhand use.”While the foundation at HasleTre is concrete, nearly every other surface (windows, framing, interior paneling) is timber. The team used standard dimensions, with no perforations in the wood, and timber-to-timber joints, all of which makes the wood more reusable. The building design includes a timber subfloor to house ductwork and electrical elements that can also be ready for resale, reuse, or reformatting down the line.Policy’s Slow GrowBerry points out that approaches similar to Flindall’s or his students’ within Making LA aren’t a huge part of architecture programs across the country just yet. “I think it’s being discussed,” he says, “but it’s not at the foreground of the conversations. It is particularly in design studios, materials classes, and building science classes, not necessarily the design. We are trying to bring that conversation through the curriculum and process.”While education helps advance the circular construction agenda, in order for the practice to gain true momentum, municipalities and government agencies will need to enact policy change. And in some places across the country, that’s already happening. Los Angeles, says Berry, has policies in place to recycle 65 percent of construction waste, with a proposal in the works that would expand the policy further. Portland, Oregon, was the first to enact deconstruction ordinances and waste removal strategies in 2016. Milwaukee followed in 2017.In San Antonio, where the population growth rate is among the highest in the country, Stephanie Phillips is at the center of a policy shift as the Deconstruction and Circular Economy Program manager at the city’s Office of Historic Preservation. The city adopted a deconstruction ordinance last year that focuses on residential property built before 1920 (citywide) and before 1945 (in historic and neighborhood conservation districts). “We have approached it incrementally,” she says. “We have made it very clear: There is a connection between deconstruction and affordable housing; it’s one of the biggest priorities for our mayor.” In fact, the office’s 2021 report shows that demolitions carried out in San Antonio in 2020 alone could have potentially salvaged structural framing to build more than 600 1,500-square-foot houses.Phillips likens it to organ donation. A building may have reached the end of its life, but its parts can repair and renew life in other older structures. The process, she says is about “reversing the dependency on replacement products and the widespread disposal of valuable cultural assets while maintaining local cultural identity and a key source of generational wealth for our longtime residents: their homes.”Phillips says her office started speaking with the area’s residents, contractors, and architects, talking them through the specifics of what design for disassembly is, as well as its related costs. She has even run three-week-long training sessions with Georgia-based Re:purpose Savannah to help local contractors level up their disassembly skillset. And when disassembly replaces demolition, there’s an opportunity to mitigate if not recoup some of a project’s cost through resale or reuse of materials.“Demo is a sunk cost,” Phillips says. “You are paying someone to throw money away. That usually gets people listening right away.” Phillips says the conversation has shifted dramatically in the past year, with residents beginning to understand the value of deconstruction and contractors and architects seeing the real benefits of a different approach.Stine’s firm, Lake Flato, is working closely with Phillips on San Antonio’s circular construction agenda. He says the biggest obstacle in this process so far has been establishing a shared understanding. People who aren’t involved in construction need to buy into the idea just as much as the contractors, government officials, designers, and architects in the city. There are the environmental benefits of circular construction and design for disassembly: less noise, less trash, less pollution, perhaps even fewer accidents. And, then of course, there are the numbers. “Cost is something everyone is always going to talk about,” says Stine. “That’s valid, but there’s a balance between that and these other aspects that we all need to continue to work on, and develop an agreement upon as a society.”Update, May 3 at 12 noon: This story was updated with links to research reports about the amount of timber that gets recycled or reused in new construction projects.","the four weeks of the Olympics and Paraolympics, says California-based architect Rob Berry. “Those buildings don’t get used after the four weeks of the Olympics and Paraolympics,” says Berry. “They become obsolete.

And it would be nice to have some more casual time with your boss not via scheduled Zoom call. But going to the office isn’t worth the time and hassle of driving and arranging childcare, and no one can have it all. Or can they?If your fictional suburban avatar works for Marriott International, then the solution to their problems may in fact be to spend more time at the office. The company opened a new 785,000-square-foot headquarters in downtown Bethesda late last year that was designed to compete—and win—against the allure of work-from-home. The first floor has a public plaza and coffee shop, the second a dining hall with outdoor seating, and the third a gym and childcare center. A doggy daycare and a spa sit just blocks from the building. You can eat, exercise, shower, and meet with your manager all in a space that feels more like a hotel rather than an office. Marriott’s headquarters, constructed almost entirely during the pandemic, was designed by Gensler, one of the world’s largest architecture and design firms. Gensler helped define the cutting edge of what the office used to be, through projects with clients including Adobe, NVIDIA, and Airbnb. Now that it has become clear that many workers prefer home over the offices of 2019, Gensler and Marriott are among a swathe of companies attempting to launch a new concept of the office that can prosper in the WFH Covid era.What does this new version of the office look like? A kaleidoscope of hotel, spa, restaurant, library, and home. “During the pandemic, when all of a sudden we’re all sitting at our dining room tables, Marriott didn’t blink. They said, ‘You know what, we agree with the strategy that an amenity-rich environment is going to draw people back to work,’” Jordan Goldstein, an architect and managing principal for Gensler, tells WIRED.Despite the enduring popularity of remote and hybrid work, many corporations have embraced plans for new office headquarters, campuses, and buildings, remaining convinced that employees need to return to the office to sustain high levels of productivity and feel connected to their company culture (or just to control their workforce, depending on who you ask).The first phase of Amazon’s second headquarters is scheduled to open in Arlington, Virginia, in the third quarter of this year (though construction of the second half has been indefinitely delayed). Apple is still planning a new campus in Durham, North Carolina. And while Google is planning to give up some leased office space, it still intends to break ground this year on a massive San Jose office and residential project.But with employees well aware of—and often in love with—their newfound ability to work from home, projects like those now have to meet new criteria: how to make the office a place that people—like you, in your hypothetical Bethesda existence—actually want to go to, even when they don’t have to.The answer, so far, involves adding design features and perks that try to be more meaningful than those of the prepandemic recent past. Open floor plans filled with a sea of desks are out. Private meeting spaces and flexible one-person offices are in. Planners like to talk about “amenity-rich environments,” meaning not just pool tables and office snacks but more practical offerings such as abundant private offices and meeting spaces, gyms, dentists, retail, and childcare.They’re all wrapped inside structures that more often feature natural light and outdoor space, sit at a central urban location, welcome the surrounding community on at least the ground floor, provide services outside the traditional remit of employer benefits, and offer flexible ways of working rather than an array of desks. The overall package, architects say, should produce a feeling of comfort—even luxury—in the office that competes with that of staying at home.“Going to the workplace should be more convenient than it is to work from home, so that the workplace earns its commute,” says Grant Kanik, a partner and workplace consultant for architects Foster and Partners, which led the design for Apple’s headquarters, Apple Park. “I call it corporate-to-comfy,” says Brian Parker, principal of the Interiors Studio at Cooper Carry, a firm that designed the State Farm office campus in Georgia and had been tapped to work on Microsoft’s potential Atlanta headquarters before the plan was paused.Before the pandemic, office buildings and campuses were often constructed almost to a formula, Parker says. The number of employees, percentage of different types of jobs, and predictions about future headcount growth went in one end; out the other came the number of desks and square feet required. Function ruled over form. The design work could even be boring. Under that model, most offices were structured with about 80 percent of usable, functional floor space for desks and 20 percent for meeting rooms. Designers spent most of their time drawing floor plans with different iterations of desks and offices and tucking conference rooms into the corners. Even before the pandemic, it wasn’t unusual for a third or even half of all desk space to go unused during parts of the day, Kanik says. Companies that did manage to heavily use their space often did so at the expense of making workers feel packed into the open floor plan.“Something wasn’t working,” says Janet Pogue McLaurin, global director of workplace research at Gensler, who identifies the same sense of pre-2020 formulaic malaise as Parker. “The pandemic provided an opportunity to rethink all that,” she says.With clients more open to new ideas and taking the time to craft each building for maximum flexibility, specific company needs, and worker appeal, designers and planners see this moment as a rare chance to implement more of their ideals and training. “The overall palette has gotten much richer in terms of what architects and designers are looking at and designing with,” says Goldstein of Gensler.Even furniture and furnishings can now be more creative, as designers and clients try to compete with home environments. For the Marriott headquarters, many of the pandemic-prompted design changes revolved around furniture rather than the actual building chassis. Office projects in general now often include more money to spend on furniture. “The shift in budget allocation on a workplace project for furniture is unbelievable,” says Parker of Cooper Carry. “It’s so much broader than putting in some chairs and tables.”Office supply companies that once focused on white desks and wheelie chairs have responded to the demand. Steelcase, one of the largest corporate furniture suppliers, has now acquired the rights to sell more than twenty “ancillary” hotel and home furniture brands to make offices more homey. Furniture from those brands, including West Elm and a collection designed in collaboration with the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation, now makes up the majority of the company’s offerings. The death of the cookie-cutter office space has also led companies to bring employees into the design process. Gensler will eventually build a 750,000-square-foot headquarters for CoStar, a commercial real estate company in Richmond, Virginia, but first the architects must gather data from employees about their preferences for meetings, training, workplace technology, health, and wellness, a practice rarely embraced by companies before the pandemic but now common across such projects.That companies feel they must reinvent the office to lure back workers raises a more fundamental question: Why bother building these structures at all? All of the architects and designers WIRED spoke with—who, to be sure, have a vested interest in office-centric work—responded to that question in a similar way. Yes, the pandemic proved that businesses can successfully operate remotely. But these planners believe that without a gathering space for a company to relay its values and build employee relationships, people become disconnected from their work. Companies need a physical space to define themselves. “The workplace is really the three-dimensional manifestation of your organization,” says Kanik of Foster and Partners. “It is the physical embodiment of your brand.”Of course, proof that these new concepts for office life are more sustainable than the old depends on people actually showing up. No “post-pandemic” building has been open for more than a few months, and no architect, no matter their design genius, can be sure they’ve figured out how to draw workers away from the comforts of working from home.",... sometimes you catch yourself dreaming of a few hours of deep-focus time. You really do need a haircut and to hit the gym more often. And yet... sometimes you catch yourself dreaming of a few hours of deep-focus time. going to the office isn’t worth the time and hassle of driving and arranging childcare.

Yup, it’s the TikTok-ification of Spotify.That might as well be the collective mantra of consumer tech companies, some of which have a well documented copycat habit. This week, it was Spotify’s turn. While not literally in Silicon Valley, in geographic terms, Spotify is for sure a tech giant. It’s the world’s biggest music streaming service, it has spent over a billion dollars building out its podcast business (which is now undergoing a strategy shift), and it says it’s approaching $40 billion in payouts to artists. It’s also known for having a comically cluttered app, and on Wednesday the company revealed a new design that’s supposed to make discovery easier. “Spotify now has different feeds for discovering songs, podcasts, and audiobooks, sporting a look that’s half TikTok’s endless scroll and half Instagram stories,” WIRED’s Amanda Hoover writes. Yup, it’s the TikTok-ification of Spotify.Your inbox doesn’t have to look like mine (overflowing with pitches for new tech) to know that the TikTok-ification of apps is very real. Google has rolled out more visual, infinite search results. YouTube has Shorts. Meta has been retooling its algorithms to force-feed Reels to Instagram users, and it now allows for the cross-posting of Reels across both IG and Facebook. Pinterest has a Watch tab for short videos. And it’s not just the big tech companies doing it. The Gen Z video dating app Snack, for one, is described as a blend of Tinder and TikTok.The froth for TikTok-like feeds is only out-foamed right now by apps using ChatGPT to … well, who knows. Does anyone know exactly what the long-term plan is for these chatbots? Microsoft, Salesforce, Snap—all “integrating” ChatGPT. Last year, app makers were coming up with new strategies for the metaverse, Web3, crypto, and NFTs, and prominent venture capitalists threw their weight behind them. This year, the buzz phrase is “generative AI,” a technology so powerful that calling it a “chatbot” seems dangerously reductive. One of the world’s largest social experiments—how we interact with technology, and how that technology affects our humanness—is starting to feel like a game of Mad Libs, in which tech executives hurry to fill in the blanks and hope that the end result doesn’t sound totally nonsensical. Silicon Valley’s collective FOMO isn’t a new phenomenon. Remember when Apple launched a music social network? When Google tried to ride the Wave? When Reddit rolled out a Clubhouse competitor? When Twitter got into newsletters? Whether driven by good old-fashioned inspiration or full-fledged FOMO, the end goal is to typically keep users engaged in their app and their app only. Or to further development of a potentially transformative technology. Often both. Sometimes, you can’t blame them for trying.  Other times, though, Silicon Valley’s FOMO is of greater consequence than a tweaked home feed or a gimmicky chatbot. Just ask any of the thousands of tech workers who were recently laid off because their CEO’s pet pivot-to-X project was deemed inessential. The new FOMO is about “focus”: who can streamline, maximize, optimize better than the next tech company. Cut enough departments, lose enough middle managers, hand it over to artificial intelligence, and the cheers from Wall Street just might drown out the uncomfortable realization that the same strategy for apps is now being applied to human capital. Finding Your Airport Uber Gets EasierIf you ever wanted to get your step count back up after a long flight, there was always … Uber. Hailing a ride from the airport has typically meant navigating a labyrinth of terminals, levels, and parking garages just to find your Uber driver. (And while that’s annoying for a weary traveler carrying luggage, it’s a nightmare for someone with mobility challenges.) Uber says it’s now addressing this issue by introducing a walking time estimate for airports and offering step-by-step navigation, complete with photos, guiding people to rideshare pickups within airports. The initial rollout will include instructions at certain terminals at 30 airports around the globe, including Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, San Francisco, Delhi, London, Madrid, Mexico City, Paris, Rome, and Sao Paulo. Uber timed the feature release to spring break, since the Transportation Security Administration anticipates spring break travel season will return to pre-pandemic levels, and since we know the thing spring breakers care most about is soberly navigating from Terminal 2 to Garage 3 and not inconveniencing their Uber drivers. Apple Music Is Serving TárI listen to a fair amount of classical music when I’m working; not because I’m any sort of expert on the genre, but because my brain doesn’t do words very well (typing) while it’s processing other words (lyrics). Most of that listening happens on Spotify—but Apple’s new app might just win me over. On March 28 the company will launch a companion app to Apple Music that’s dedicated to classical music. It’s called Apple Music Classical, and it will be included in the $10 per month subscription fee for Apple’s existing music service or offered as a part of Apple’s more expensive cloud bundles. Classical music might not seem like it would be a, ahem, key part of Apple Music, considering that classical makes up a small fraction of all music streaming. But Apple signaled its intentions to cue the orchestra a couple of years ago when it acquired a classical music service called Primephonic, as ArsTechnica writes. Primephonic had created a search function that let users search for alternate spellings of composers’ names or performances by specific artists. It also created a payment structure in which payouts were based on how long a piece was played for—an important consideration when tracks are 20 minutes long—versus how many times a track was played. Plus, Apple has been creating some interesting experiences around spatial audio with AirPods and HomePods. It’s easy to imagine how a dedicated app for orchestral music might tap into that technology. This is total speculation on my part, but if it happens, you read it here first. Pinterest Also Has a Content Moderation ProblemAn NBC News investigation has revealed that users on Pinterest are aggregating seemingly innocuous images of children into sexually suggestive collections of “pins,” as images are called on Pinterest. This means adult users on the platform are able to easily find images of children—say, of a young girl doing a cartwheel—and pin them to Pinterest boards titled “sexy little girls” or “hot” or “delicious,” which then allows other users with similar intentions to find them. As the story states, aggregating these individually innocuous images of minors is, in many cases, lawful. Yet, reporter Jesselyn Cook writes, “Pinterest isn’t just allowing this to happen on its website—its recommendation engine is making it easy. The company is inadvertently curating this content for adults who seek it out and potentially exposing the girls to pedophiles.”A spokesperson for Pinterest told NBC News that the company has a zero-tolerance policy on “any content that may exploit or endanger minors” and said the company immediately takes down sexually suggestive boards that contain otherwise innocuous or nonsexual images. It also bans those users from Pinterest. One thing Pinterest hasn’t offered to date is the ability to simply report boards, though now the company says it will roll that out. Feature of the WeekDevelopers got a sneak preview of the latest version of Android 14 this week, and it includes more bio-authentication features that work similarly to FaceID on iPhones. “Once the update hits, it will make it easier to log in to any account you have stored in your password chain, besides a Google one, with your face or fingerprint,” Gizmodo writes, adding that this should make it easier to multitask—securely—between different accounts.Paging PixarA bunch of goats were seen running around downtown San Francisco during rush hour this week, and no one knows why or how they got there.

gear,https://www.wired.com/story/tomtex-chitosan-leather-alternative/,Replace the Leather in Your Wallet With Seafood Waste,Alden Wicker,"It looked, quite frankly, like the future. For two years since the founding of TômTex, Tran says, she has carried this wallet—an early prototype crafted from her company's bio-based synthetic leather—with her everywhere. The black, subtly shimmering snakeskin material had gently conformed to the shape of her credit cards, just like a well-loved, real leather wallet. More importantly, unlike most leather alternatives, which are made of petroleum-derived materials like polyurethane and PVC, it showed no signs of peeling or cracking. It looked, quite frankly, like the future. The fashion and automotive industries are racing to discover the perfect animal-free leather to displace at least some of the almost $243 billion global market for leather. And what’s clear is the startup with the most affordable, durable, beautiful, biodegradable, and—this is the hard part—fossil-fuel-free material will win the spoils.That was what drew me to this small conference room at Newlab, the tech startup incubator in the Navy Yard in Brooklyn, New York. Just a month before, an email had dropped into my inbox promising all these miracle properties, along with an invitation to come look at the product and meet the team.“Polyurethane and PVC are often at least two-part laminates, often three- or four-part laminates,” Ross McBee, TômTex’s cofounder and chief science officer, explained from across the table as I turned the wallet over in my hands. Pleather materials are usually composed of a topcoat, a compact layer, a foam layer, and a textile base layer, making them prone to failure far faster than leather. They’re also a type of plastic, something that gets lost (or intentionally omitted) in the marketing hype for “vegan” leathers.Even in vegan leathers that purport to be plant-based, including AppleLeather, Vegea grape leather, Desserto cactus leather, and Mylo mushroom leather, a hefty portion of the layers, binders, and finishes are fossil-fuel-based plastics. (The exceptions are Natural Fiber Welding’s Mirum and some versions of the eye-wateringly expensive Reishi mushroom leather by MycoWorks.) One study tested several of these plant-based leather alternatives and found harmful substances, including the reproductive toxic dimethylformamide (DMFa); the volatile organic compound toluene, which has been linked to birth defects and pregnancy loss, liver damage, and central nervous system damage; butanone oxime; the potential carcinogen free isocyanate; the pesticide folpet; and the hormone-disrupting diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP). The leather alternative by TômTex that I was holding didn’t have binders or finishes, or any petroleum at all. It’s what’s known in the consumer products world as a mono-material, made of 100 percent chitosan (pronounced “kai-toe-san”), a biopolymer. Chitosan is created from chitin, the building block for crustacean shells, mushroom cell walls, and insect exoskeletons, making it one of the most abundant biopolymers on earth. That ubiquity makes it cheap and easy to source—just scoop up the shrimp shell waste coming out of the enormous global seafood industry. It’s so cheap that chitosan’s most popular use right now is in wastewater treatment plants as a flocculant. A chitosan solution is poured into the dirty water, causing particles to clump and fall to the bottom. Yeah, it’s basically a large-scale toilet water cleaner.“So it’s not hundreds of dollars a gram or whatever,” McBee said. “This is not pharma … This is a semi-commodity.” (Though, unsurprisingly, there are wellness influencers claiming chitosan that as a supplement can fight cancer, plus improve dental and mental health, with little to no evidence.)TômTex takes the raw chitosan, which is shipped as white flakes in fluffy, pillow-shaped bags, and turns it into dope, or a viscous brown liquid. Colors can be mixed right in, and then it is poured into molds, stamped, or even 3D printed. (TômTex says it uses natural pigments such as charcoal, coffee, and ochre.) The result is an affordable, biodegradable, recyclable, durable, semi-breathable, realistic replacement for cow leather. And it’s so non-toxic as to be edible. “It doesn’t taste awesome,” McBee admitted. (Yes, he’s tried it.) “We’ve gotten to really learn about their innovation, and we’re super impressed,” says Cintia Nunes, general manager and head of Asia at the Hong Kong–based venture capital fund Mills Fabrica, which supports sustainable innovation in the fashion material and food sectors. TômTex, a technology that plays in both those spaces, won Mills Fabrica’s 2020 TechStyle For Social Good award, and a sample is currently on display at the Fabrica (X) store as part of a half-year exhibit of biomaterials.PETA might protest that chitosan isn’t technically vegan, but as a waste byproduct of the seafood industry, it doesn’t come with all the environmental baggage of cow leather, which has been linked in the public’s popular imagination to Amazon rainforest destruction and climate change.“I do think it’s—from an overall sustainability move—a good thing to be moving in that direction. But our mission is to take animals out of the equation,” says Sydney Gladman, chief scientific officer at the think tank Material Innovation Institute (MII). She worked with chitosan during her PhD. “It has really intriguing properties,” she says. Mainly, that it’s actually biodegradable and compostable.McBee says TômTex does have a mushroom-based version for brands that want to prioritize the vegan aspect. But according to Gladman, growing or sourcing mushrooms is pricier than the “millions of tons probably of shrimp waste that they can rely upon.”TômTex is also a fairly unique material startup in that it represents a non-Westerner’s approach to the problem of fashion’s impact. Tran was born and raised in Vietnam, and witnessed the country become a powerhouse producer of technical fashion. That manufacturing growth brought textile pollution with it, instilling in her a drive to improve the industry. As a fashion designer, having worked for Alexander Wang and Ralph Lauren, she took each iteration of TômTex to an industrial sewing machine for testing. Her fashion industry connections also helped her kickstart the material's adoption by designers. The luxury Vietnamese designer Peter Do, whom she worked for before cofounding the startup, sent models out on the runway for his Spring/Summer 2023 presentation wearing TômTex trousers, and the experimental couture trio threeASFOUR has also prototyped bags using TômTex.“We’ve chosen them based on their maturity,” Nunes of Mills Fabrica says. “Yes, [they’re at the] lab stage, but they’re able to get some pilots going, which is very important to really show the product, show the texture, and be able to have conversations with businesses. Not many [material startups] are able to do that. They would just be stuck at a lab.” The team believes its chitosan formulation can be slotted right into currently available machinery for producing polyurethane or PVA (that plastic film used in laundry pods), so production of shrimp-leather goods could be scaled up quickly. Now TômTex is moving operations from a small lab in Newlab to a larger pilot production space a short walk away in the Navy Yard, where the company can hopefully prove its thesis. The cofounders walked me over to see it, but the facility was just a suggestion of what it could be. They were still waiting for the electrical to be installed, and all the lab equipment was plugged into one overworked extension cord. The small setup in the middle of the room looked like a combination of a bakery and a lab, with advanced technical equipment, a commercial-grade food dryer, and shelves piled with beakers and cookie sheets. The air smelled ever-so-slightly sweet, likely because chitosan, a polysaccharide, is turned into something that looks like molasses during the manufacturing process. (And no, there’s no shellfish odor.)A construction bucket of jaggedly cut old material samples in a rainbow of colors and textures sat on the floor. McBee said they’ve melted down old samples and made them into new samples. In some cases, the chitosan leather has been melted down and reconstituted twice, which is twice more than most other vegan leathers. “I don’t want to promise that the very, very final version of this will be this, because this changes depending on the certain chemistry,” he said. “But at the moment, the recipe is something where you could take a final sheet and basically melt it back down.”That’s music to the ears of the fashion industry, which has been talking up the distant utopia of a circular economy, where used clothing and accessories are endlessly looped through the supply chain to create new products. It wasn’t until a couple of months ago, when the TômTex team figured out how to make the material water-resistant, that they had the confidence to start sharing the leather replacement with larger brands and the press. TômTex is now in talks with a large leather goods brand, an athletic wear brand, and a sneaker brand to start using its material in mass-market products. Behind the table with the 3D printer, a whiteboard listed some of the world’s largest fashion corporations with production quantities next to them. Getting a commitment from those brands to buy a certain amount of product will be key, says Nunes. “The type of thing that investors love to hear is yes, we’re getting commitments, and all these companies and brands are very interested. That’s when the investors will invest in the money, and then get them the facility they need in order to produce the capacity that they need to be able to serve these brands.”TômTex hopes to be producing its leather replacement on the scale of 100,000 yards a year by the end of 2023, which is a lightning-fast timeline compared to many of the other fashion material innovations that have been in development for a decade or more. “We’re hopeful that within this year, there’ll be something that people can actually get their hands on,” McBee said.That might be optimistic, and will depend on how successful TômTex is in this fundraising round and the attendant technology refinement stage. Gladman at MII says the institute expects a slowdown and consolidation in the leather alternative market this year, which has dozens of entrants who have been chugging along for almost a decade with little in the way of consumer products to show for it.“We think some startups might fail,” Gladman says. “And it’s a little sad, but at the same time, it’s a sign of progress in the industry.”If it keeps going at this pace, TômTex might end up coming from behind to win.",", the future. It looked, quite frankly, like the future. It looked, quite frankly, like the future. Tran says she has carried this wallet with her everywhere. unlike most synthetic leather alternatives, it showed no signs of peeling or cracking."
gear,https://www.wired.com/story/soren-iverson-interview/,Zillow Rate Your Neighbors? A Designer Reimagines Apps,Lauren Goode,"Using the interface design tool Figma, Iverson mocked up a Wrapped for Google Maps, Robinhood, and Starbucks and shared the images to Twitter. The tweets received a modest amount of attention, garnering hundreds of likes each, but Iverson was just getting started. Nearly every day since, he has imagined clever new features that add unexpected touches to our most well-worn apps. There’s ChatGPT, but in Apple Messages. Instagram, but with the option to pay a fee to undo “deep likes.” Lyft-style reviews, but for Tinder (“Looked Like Pics!”). And, the ones that went certifiably viral: Beat Minesweeper to cancel your subscription, and iOS alarms, but for the whole household, so the alarm is only disabled once everyone is up. Back in 2015, the music streaming company launched Wrapped, a year-end recap for each user that offered insights into their music listening habits and the year’s most popular artists. Other brands began borrowing the idea, a shameless if entertaining ploy to ratchet up engagement. This December, Iverson, a digital designer, wondered what Wrapped would look like when applied to our most basic apps. Using the interface design tool Figma, Iverson mocked up a Wrapped for Google Maps, Robinhood, and Starbucks and shared the images to Twitter. The tweets received a modest amount of attention, garnering hundreds of likes each, but Iverson was just getting started. Nearly every day since, he has imagined clever new features that add unexpected touches to our most well-worn apps. There’s ChatGPT, but in Apple Messages. Instagram, but with the option to pay a fee to undo “deep likes.” Lyft-style reviews, but for Tinder (“Looked Like Pics!”). And, the ones that went certifiably viral: Beat Minesweeper to cancel your subscription, and iOS alarms, but for the whole household, so the alarm is only disabled once everyone is up. Iverson’s satirical design concepts started popping up in my own timeline with regularity, and whether that’s because they’ve now achieved a certain virality or because Twitter’s algorithmic timeline has been tweaked, it’s hard to say (it may be both). So I reached out to Iverson, who works full-time as a Cash App designer when he’s not reinventing other apps, to ask about his design process. We talked about how tech companies are responding to his ideas, and what he thinks the popularity of his absurdist app features say about our current relationships with technology. Iverson also shared an app idea that an Instagram engineer liked so much he said he might pitch it internally. The conversation has been edited for clarity and length. WIRED: What inspired you to start sharing these app ideas?Soren Iverson: Well, several years ago, Spotify created this Wrapped experience, and from a product management perspective, it was a huge success. People loved it. And it seems like now every product manager working on every other app is trying to transpose this model of thinking onto their own app. This December it felt like it was at the point where everyone was doing it. So I just decided, OK, as a thought experiment, what would happen if Starbucks did this? What would happen if DoorDash did this? What would happen if Google Maps did this? The idea was around taking their internalized success metrics—this person drove this much or ordered this many cups of coffee—and throwing it back at you, the user. I often think in visuals, so I immediately saw the thing in my head and mocked it up. And people reacted positively to it. They thought it was funny. And it just kind of blew up.Initially my positioning was, “This product, comma, insert other feature or UI here.” But now my positioning is more, what if a PM knew Figma really well and gave an app their most intrusive thoughts? And it’s been a really fun exercise. There are a couple people in particular I riff with [Iverson later identified them as Josh Rozin and Gauthier Le Meur], and sometimes they text me stuff and I’m like, that’s just insane. I have to admit that I had never come across your work until probably the past two months. But you’re also not the only person on Twitter right now whom I’m suddenly seeing a lot more of. Like Derek Guy, the menswear writer, or Nicole LePera, the therapist. So now I’m thinking, OK, the Twitter algorithm is telling me I need better fashion and I need more therapy. And now there are reports that Elon Musk is tweaking the feed so that we see more Elon tweets. I’m also enjoying your app ideas. So it’s not like I mind it. I’m just not sure what to credit for the fact that your designs are filling the feed. Same. I’m seeing people posting that Elon complained that his metrics were buried, and now their feed is just an Elon tweet every other tweet. So yeah, that’s one way to do it. It’s interesting because there's some stuff that I post that you can tell it stays within the Design Twittersphere, and then sometimes, like with the Group Alarms or the Uber Hot Box design, they expand beyond the scope of Tech Twitter and it gets a little out of control. So now I have to be much more upfront, that everything is satirical, because I don’t want it to be misleading at all. I figured, this stuff is so absurd, no one is going to take it the wrong way. But I’m trying to be more clear with that moving forward. You say your designs are satirical. But are they? Like earlier this week, the idea that users on Tinder should have a sense of how many other people someone is dating—that’s quite funny and I’m not sure entirely satirical. That’s the thing. It’s a fine line. And I guess we should talk about whether this is art. Because if I’m not explaining myself and putting something out there and letting people interpret it, it’s similar to what someone making art would do. Most people aren’t thinking about Big Tech product design as an artistic discipline. And I’m not going to say I’m “an artist” because that just feels pretentious and in a way this is something anyone could do, just pick this thing up and subvert it a little bit. So I guess it’s more like comedy to me. There’s some levity, and it’s a change of pace from the things that are very serious right now. For me, it’s putting play back into work.What’s your favorite app feature you’ve come up with so far? Ummm …I’m asking you to choose your favorite child. That’s hard. You can’t choose your favorite kid. It’s funny because a lot of times, the ones I think are really good don’t do as well with a larger audience. Yeah, that happens with news stories too! I think my favorite one so far is the TicketMaster one. That really riled people up and I think blurred the line between reality and absurdity. Have any of the app companies gotten in touch with you and indicated they might actually build one of these features? Well, the Instagram Pay to Undo Deep Likes got some attention. “Deep Likes” is the phenomenon of you liking someone’s photo from three years ago when you’re going deep into their profile. And my idea was that you could undo that like and do it without anyone seeing that you’ve liked the old photo for a small fee. I posted that and an engineering manager from Instagram said they were going to pitch it internally without the payment upsell. That’s the closest I’ve gotten in terms of someone actually shipping one of my ideas. What do you think the absurdity of your designs says about the app experience we’re having today and our broader relationships to technology? It’s difficult because everyone has a different read on it. The interesting thing I’ve found is that, I have some friends who just don’t work in the technology industry at all and they either get such a kick out of these or they say, Oh, this has such a Black Mirror vibe to it. And it has made me realize that these lines between our current way of living and our perceptions of dystopia are really, really thin. These seemingly minuscule changes to a thing you use every day can have enormous consequences. You change a couple words—like Slack Read Receipts—people got so angry. Livid. And there was a precedent for this; Microsoft Teams has it, WhatsApp as it. But someone tweeted it was setting the stage for a “white collar revolt in the making.” A lot of art, historically, was placed with the concept of place. Like in the 1900s to early 2000s, people might put something on the radio, or on TV, or place it within the context of a billboard. Now technology is everywhere. It’s a huge part of what we interact with every day. It seems like your DMV in the Metaverse design didn’t land as well as your mobile app ideas. I wonder if it’s because the metaverse is less relatable and already so absurd on its own that it doesn’t require a feature change to point out the absurdity. I think part of it, too, is just what people expect when they come to a feed. Anything hardware-related, people don’t grasp immediately. Like I came up with Mike’s Hard Sorbet, and it performed fine but it wasn’t like people went crazy for it. Also, the one I posted about the metaverse was extremely busy. It’s important to have a focal point. So with Play Minesweeper to Cancel Subscription or the Snap Map for the Chinese Spy Balloon, there’s a very clear center to the idea.Have you been tempted at all to use generative AI products to make these designs? No. Partly because I want to futureproof my career, but also because it feels disingenuous. I’ve talked to other people who are using it, but I’ve never used AI. Right now design tooling is still prohibitive, I think. Like you need to know a lot of tools to design things. I think eventually, if you look at something like Galileo, where you type in an input and it spits out a UI for you, the barrier will come down for non-designers to create output. Which I do think has a lot of implications for the things I’m doing. The minute that things become ubiquitous enough that anyone can grab the keys and start driving, it’s going to get pretty interesting.

WIRED spoke to Destiny Universe Lead Concept Artist Dima Goryainov at Bungie to understand this illustration of Darkness through the Pyramid Fleet, and touch on some of the design elements we’ve seen in the game’s upcoming expansion, Lightfall.Forces of the Darkness have stood against the Traveler’s Light throughout Destiny and Destiny 2. For years, the story was largely Light versus Darkness, with humanity on the side of the Light and enemies like the Hive, the Taken, and others on the side of the Darkness. It wasn’t until 2022’s The Witch Queen expansion for Destiny 2 that the sibylline messenger of the Darkness, known as the Witness, was identified, giving players a closer look inside the Pyramid Fleet—where its peculiar design revealed characteristics of this long-standing, elusive enemy. The Pyramid Fleet stands as something more ancient than anything else seen in-game and incomprehensibly technologically advanced—as if the Fleet were around forever. WIRED spoke to Destiny Universe Lead Concept Artist Dima Goryainov at Bungie to understand this illustration of Darkness through the Pyramid Fleet, and touch on some of the design elements we’ve seen in the game’s upcoming expansion, Lightfall.WIRED: The Disciple’s Bog area in Savathun’s Throne World—which has the Vow of the Disciple raid, Preservation mission, and the Birthplace of the Vile strike—establishes an alien, ancient environment for the Pyramid Fleet with its dark architecture contrasting with vibrant murals. What about the Darkness inspired this puzzling, avant-garde setting?Dima Goryainov: Visual and thematic contrast plays an important role in Destiny’s overall identity. The Throne World is no exception. For this particular destination, the role of contrast was to really show who Savathûn was in the past, and who she has become. The swamp area outside of the castle, where the Pyramid is located, is meant to feel long abandoned, as she abandons her connection to the Darkness. The tangled roots, deep mud, and heavy atmosphere help convey the feeling that you are being gradually drawn in and consumed, just as Savathûn was consumed. By contrast, the castle is bathed in light, symbolizing her rebirth.As with many aspects of Destiny, when designing the visuals for the Pyramid palette, we wanted to make sure that all of the grandiose and fantastical elements are to some degree still grounded in the familiar. The sense of scale, austerity, and mystery found in ancient Egyptian, Babylonian, and Sumerian architecture provided a strong foundation for us to build upon. Once we had some of those baseline features figured out, we could then combine them with elements of paracausal mysticism, abstract art, esoteric graphic design, cosmic mythology, etc. All of this is meant to depict the Pyramid Fleet as something that is rich in history and full of character. Abstract artwork tells a story without being obvious, and murals across the Pyramid ship represent the Light and the Darkness. Even the miniature illustrations/graphics for the Vow of the Disciple raid callouts display a story on the prophecy wall. Seeing that you’ve taken the visual and spiritual qualities from films like Color of Pomegranates, Holy Mountain, and the art of Hilma af Klint, what do these murals tell players? Especially this one: The green, yellow, and blue on the right side of the image have puzzled me and many players that have come across it.There’s most certainly a purpose to the graphic design within the Pyramids. Without going too far into specific detail, the high-level goal was to add a sense of culture and history to these ancient spaces. The thing I love about the references you mentioned is that, in their own way, these films and artworks all seem to convey complex or personal concepts through bold use of color, pattern, and composition. It’s up to the viewer to interpret them and each person might see something totally different. The graphics of the Pyramid is our attempt to touch on something similar. In this case, graphic design is used as another tool to express the complex relationship between Darkness and Light, as well as hint at a long history between the two forces that stretches far beyond what our Guardians have seen and experienced.  Different art styles, shapes, and designs are introduced in Destiny 2 through the branding of seasons or the introduction of new factions. This colorful abstraction seemed unique to Disciple’s Bog, but in the Lightfall preview, we see Tormentors bearing similar designs. Do these designs signify the Darkness, or is it like a Fallen House banner where different factions have different branding?Without getting too specific, these designs, depending on application, are meant to convey abstract ideas, processes, or ideologies that unify the Darkness. So, they’re not strictly contained to the Bog, but instead create a sense of continuity between Pyramid visuals as a whole.The Pyramid ship on the Moon—introduced in the Shadowkeep expansion—was characterized by Nightmares. The one on Europa has the Crux of Darkness, a ziggurat, and a veiled statue that came from the perspective of worship; it also gave players Stasis. Memory played a big role in Rhulk’s ship and the Relic on Mars through Deepsight Resonant psychic abilities, worm displays, and Rhulk’s eclectic museum. Are ship designs based on a theme, or do Disciples characterize them?It’s a bit of both, really. The ships we have seen so far definitely have unique overarching themes, but the beings that occupy them certainly influence what you may find. In some ways, this variation in visual themes is a way to show that the Darkness itself is varied, enigmatic, and complex. Much like a character, it can evolve over time, revealing new details, or creating new mysteries. This aspect is what makes it one of my favorite visuals to work on within the Destiny universe.On Twitter, you mentioned how the colorful, game-piece-like objects in the Disciple’s Bog, Mars Relic, and the Europa Pyramid ship exhibit playfulness through “Pyramid technology.” However, I found it interesting how the Witness says, “You have no pieces left to place, the game is over,” to the Traveler at the end of The Witch Queen story. Does this playful design also represent the Witness as the ghoulish mastermind calling all the shots in this game of Light versus Darkness?The aim of Pyramid tech was to suggest a culture that has existed long enough for art, technology, and science to converge and become indistinguishable from one another. Hopefully, this direction also creates a balance between relatability and mystery. For example, a lot of the tech pieces have recognizable elements of puzzles, games, musical instruments, and sculptures; yet although their design feels purposeful, the actual function is often unknown. As far as the relationship of these visuals to the Witness, I think they speak to the strategic and elegant nature of this being. All we know is that there is a plan and pieces are being moved into place, but more about the Witness and its role in the Light and Dark saga will be revealed soon!Sign Up TodaySign up for our Games newsletter and never miss our latest gaming tips, reviews, and features.The Pyramid Fleet stands apart from the flora-ridden, organic space in Garden of Salvation, where players first “met” the Darkness in the original Destiny. Even the Leviathan ship grew strange plants after its interaction with Dark forces. What sets the sleek Pyramid structures apart from other Darkness-associated places?The Darkness is a neutral force of nature that can be interacted with in many different ways. What we’re seeing with the Pyramids is the result of the Witness’ interaction with this force. It is the physical manifestation of experiencing the Darkness through the lens of the Witness’ history, culture, and ideas. Outside of the Witness’ influence, the Darkness may take on a completely different form and be used for a completely different purpose. Fleet invasions aren’t new to Destiny, yet this feels different from seeing a Cabal or Fallen ship. The Witness and its Pyramid Fleet embody the Darkness, and since environments are forms of visual storytelling, what are the Fleet designs aesthetically communicating to the player?The Pyramids represent the highest level of power that we have seen in the Destiny universe so far. They’re far more inscrutable than anything we would see from the Cabal or the Fallen because we don’t know the full limit of their power or how they will behave. They’re an unstoppable force that is responsible for the greatest calamity in humanity’s history, the Collapse. In contrast to the Traveler, they bring a heavy sense of dread and hopelessness. However, they also beg to be explored. Their enigmatic nature provides small glimpses into a world beyond our own space and time, revealing clues about the vast history of Light and Dark, and showing us that things are not always as they seem.The newness of Calus’ Pyramid Ship resting above the futuristic living city of Neomuna, seen in the Lightfall trailers, deviates from past expansions that feature lifeless and worn destinations—often relating to the Golden Age. Has the arrival of the Darkness evolved the game's design and opened up new horizons for the future?The Darkness certainly provided an interesting narrative framework for why we would go to Neomuna, but as a general principle we constantly want to challenge ourselves and create visuals that feel new and unexpected to our players. Therefore, even in the absence of Darkness, we would still be looking for ways to evolve our design and open up new horizons. ",",, and touch on some of the design elements we’ve seen in the game’s upcoming expansion, Lightfall.WIRED: The Disciple’s Bog area in Savathun’s Throne World—which has the Vow of the Disciple raid, Preservation mission, and the Birthplace of the Vile strike—establishes an alien, ancient environment for the Pyramid Fleet."

He says people get passionate about fonts, even if they don’t realize it right away. “When you change a typeface, you change somebody’s subconscious understanding of the text,” Shallcrass says. “We get very attached to these things.”As a 21st-century update, Calibri makes sense. It is a digital-first typeface, as opposed to Times New Roman, which was created in 1931 for print newspapers and then reverse-engineered into a digital font. Calibri also has a larger character set, allowing it to be used for more languages and in more use cases than Times. But while it’s younger than Times, Calibri is not the most modern of fonts. Microsoft adopted Calibri as its default typeface in 2007, but in 2021 the company indicated plans to phase it out.Fred Shallcrass is a typeface designer at the New York studio Frere-Jones Type who helped design Seaford, one of the fonts Microsoft is considering making its new default typeface. He says people get passionate about fonts, even if they don’t realize it right away. “When you change a typeface, you change somebody’s subconscious understanding of the text,” Shallcrass says. “We get very attached to these things.”The move has re-sparked a long running debate about the merits and readability of serif versus sans serif fonts. Times New Roman is a serif typeface; it has little bobs, caps, and curls at the edges of letters that give the typeface its distinctive look. Calibri is a sans serif typeface; it has much cleaner letterforms that lack all the bunting. Prevailing wisdom in the modern age is that sans serif fonts are easier to read on screens, which is why the State Department says it initiated the change.“Complicated serifs get a bad rap,” Shallcrass says. “Newer screens are sharper, so it’s far less of a concern than it used to be. In some ways, this is a dated approach. This would’ve made more sense if it was 10 years ago.”No one typeface will work for every experience. Our brains may find it manageable to read a piece of prose in a typeface where some characters have complex shapes or look like other characters. But people with reading comprehension difficulties or impaired vision may find such a typeface a chore to navigate. No single typeface is ideal for every type of visual or cognitive impairment, but the State Department’s choice of Calibri should go far in making text easier for almost everyone to read.“The fact that the government is having a conversation like this about accessibility is kind of heartwarming,” says Jason Santa Maria, a designer and author of the book On Web Typography. “You want your government agencies to care about this kind of stuff, if this kind of thinking trickles out to other places where text and accessibility are paramount.”Fonts adapt with the technology we use to read them on. What works on screens today could feel dated in a few years. The State Department’s decision to adopt a typeface that’s already on its way out may cause concerns among the font faithful, but government agencies are famously slow and stodgy, so the switch to Calibri is hardly surprising. Still, it’s possible that no default will ever be perfect forever.“Typefaces are kind of in the same category as clothes and furniture and decor,” Santa Maria says. “Fashion changes and moods and sensibilities change over time. Fonts also need to adapt.”",", which was created in 1931 for print newspapers and then reverse-engineered into a digital font.

Today, there’s much more evidence to show that bad design can have a range of negative consequences, with studies showing that it can cause mental stress and even lead to crime and antisocial behavior. By 2050, seven out of 10 people worldwide will live in a city. Yet, despite the modern world’s technological advances, we have continued to create soulless spaces that reflect none of this genius. Whether you’re in downtown Hong Kong, Paris’s financial district, or central Toronto, the human touch has vanished from urban design while social isolation is growing and people are feeling increasingly overwhelmed and burnt out.However, I believe change is coming. Before, you could get away with thinking “less is more.” Now it’s becoming clear that emotion matters when designing buildings and urban spaces.In 2023, cities will start waking up to the value of emotion. Architects and designers will begin to embrace the idea that the aesthetic quality and the diversity of buildings deeply affect our feelings and have the power to lift our spirits, engage, and connect us.CEOs, retailers, developers, and architects will start to think more about how urban planning can entice, engage, and inspire. Boring will gradually cease to be competitive. Forward-thinking businesses will start to respond by changing how they commission new buildings. Examples have already begun appearing—from Leeds, where Acme Studio infused personality and breathed new life to a derelict industrial site, to Burkina Faso, where Kéré Architects created a soulful health center in the city of Leo. The climate emergency will accelerate this change. Construction is one of the planet’s biggest polluters—38 percent of energy-related CO2 emissions in 2018 were generated by the sector alone. Every year, an area equivalent to the size of Washington, DC is demolished in the US. In Britain, the average commercial building is sentenced to demolition before it even turns 40. In 2023, we will see increasing outrage at the wastefulness of this approach to urban planning.Individual concerns for the health of the planet will play a part. This year’s heat waves have already resulted in calls to make our streets greener. In 2023, the global movement to plant more trees in cities will grow even stronger. Green infrastructure will be understood to be critical national infrastructure, just like energy and transport, and we will have a tree for each person in every city around the world.In 2023, we will finally begin to join the dots between building places people love and protecting the planet. Passion for the places that surround us will become key to designing streets and buildings full of detail, invention, and three-dimensionality. These new and radically human spaces will be cherished and will serve each resident and visitor for many years to come, instead of joining the graveyard of drab structures that none of us ever really cared to care for.","buildings have become boring—flat, plain, shiny, rectangular, monotonous, anonymous, characterless, and dull.

backchannel,https://www.wired.com/story/tony-fadell-is-trying-to-build-the-ipod-of-crypto-ledger-stax/,Tony Fadell Is Trying to Build the iPod of Crypto,Steven Levy,"“We’ve got seven weeks to pull this off,” he says. “Are we going to pull this off?” At the meeting we enter, everyone is speaking English. People are sitting at a large table. On the walls are labels such as PHOTO ASSETS, VIEW FROM LANDING PAGE, USER FLOW, with big printouts taped below. Fadell strides to the front of the room.“We’ve got seven weeks to pull this off,” he says. “Are we going to pull this off?” The people in the room say yes, they will pull it off. They sound confident, weary, but ready for the next round of work. Each person says what they have done since the last time they met. Fadell responds with questions. What’s the drop-dead date on the plastic blanks? Where’s the press release? Are we recording the click-click-click? I want to hear it!The click remark reminds everyone, as if they needed it, that Fadell once led the team at Apple that created the iPod, with its elegant clicky wheel and revolutionary interface. He also cofounded Nest and created its smart thermostat, which Google then acquired. Fadell circles the room to examine the printouts, which describe the product rollout. A man with a video camera follows him, recording the moment for posterity and promotional use. Fadell stops to examine a group of photos of the device: a hardware wallet called Ledger Stax. A hardware wallet is a utilitarian thing. It’s a physical lock for digital secrets. When you own cryptocurrency, your balance is protected solely by a private key that can be devilishly hard to keep safe. Ledger’s wallets, made of steel and silicon (and, OK, plastic), act as tiny vaults, but so far they have been off-putting. Much like crypto itself. Fadell is reinventing this gadget, his first major design project in years. He has come to believe that by giving it the panache of the hottest consumer gadgets, he will redirect the crypto field, just as he helped kick off digital music and the smart home.Fadell looks at the photos of the credit-card-sized wallet and its innovative E Ink touchscreen. When Ledger reveals it on December 6, it will cost $279. That's a rounding error for those who buy Bored Apes. To add a bit of flair, the screen wraps around one side, giving it the equivalent of the spine on a book. But the photo doesn’t show this enough. “It’s very rectilinear and 2D,” he says. “Not enough spine. I’m not feeling the curve.” He frowns. “And it’s so dark.”David Sloo, a user experience designer who worked with Fadell at Nest, picks up on the critique. “Can we be less Darth Vader and more Rebel?”Fadell agrees. “It’s really who we are—it’s all about the Empire.”His remark is a segue to the next panel, marked MANIFESTO. A handful of slogans are taped to the glass.Crypto is the new money.Security is a human right.Welcome to a new era of financial freedom.The first touchscreen device made to protect your most valuable assets.Fadell looks the hardest at one that reads: In [L] Stax We Trust.He is not satisfied with the prominence of the [L], the Ledger logo, which appears in a custom military-style typeface. The brand is what people should remember. “In five years, every time you see that L you’ll think Ledger,” he says. “Like the Apple logo stands for the brand.”The comparison seems absurd. The company is nowhere near that size, its product is alien to most Earthlings, and its niche—crypto—has been undergoing months of shock treatment. Fadell seems unfazed.“It’s coming together,” he says. “Forty-nine days!”During those 49 days, the arc of crypto will bend into a dunk tank. Timing, as product gurus know, is everything. Stax might be coming at the perfect moment. It could as easily be the worst. LEDGER WAS FOUNDED in 2014 by members of a Bitcoin collective called La Maison du Bitcoin. They wanted to build a wallet for crypto purists. These people would never leave their private keys on a phone or laptop—too hackable—or park their holdings in an exchange, which is a trusted, centralized institution and no better than a bank. (“Trust” is a pejorative in this world.) That was the year thousands of people lost their investments in a hack of crypto’s flagship exchange, Mt. Gox, wiping out many customers’ life savings. Ledger’s savvy consumers would entrust their keys only to a hardware wallet, something they could hold in their hands even when servers went down and exchanges went bust. You’d begin a transaction on a phone or laptop and use the wallet to verify it. Your private key, marooned on its Alcatraz, would never cross the gap to those less secure devices. The company’s first wallet, released late that year, was nothing special. But it satisfied a need among some crypto folk. Subsequent models got tiny displays. Ledger ultimately sold more than 5 million of its wallets, which it says now secure 20 percent of the world’s crypto and more than 30 percent of NFTs. True believers wear Ledger wallets around their necks. By 2018, however, the crypto market had plunged into one of its cold spells, and Ledger’s sales were flat. An early investor named Pascal Gauthier came to believe that a fusty mentality was hindering the company’s growth. “The French engineer decides everything, which is why the French always come up with innovations, but we’re shitty at taking them to market and making it a business,” he says. He became part of a boardroom uprising that put him in charge. Sign Up TodaySign up for our Longreads newsletter for the best features, ideas, and investigations from WIRED.Gauthier, who had worked in ad tech (first at Yahoo and then as COO of a successful French company called Criteo), wanted to move Ledger from the “B to G” market—business to geek—and sell to the wider, nontechnical world. He wanted to mix Ledger’s rigid security focus with the verve of Steve Jobs-level creativity. “Maybe it’s delusional,” says Gauthier, who dresses as if awaiting a Sun Valley invitation, in an ever-present black Patagonia vest. “But I want to build things at scale, to build a company in Europe that will compete with Apple, Google.” He felt Ledger needed to shake off a bit of its Frenchness. “If you want marketing and sales, you need Americans,” he says. “There is no other way.” Gauthier started by wooing an expatriate he’d befriended. Ian Rogers is an Iggy Pop-ish 50-year-old with long blond hair, tattoos on his fingers, and a résumé loaded with trophy jobs, albeit trophies seldom found in the same case. He played in a high school band called Albino K-Mart Shoppers, was webmaster for the Beastie Boys, CEO of Beats Music, cofounder of Apple Music, and digital czar of the luxury-brand juggernaut LVMH, a gig that brought him to the City of Lights.By 2020, though, he was open to Gauthier’s pitch. He’d long been interested in crypto, having read the foundational Satoshi paper in 2009. Gauthier was offering him a chance to participate in what he regarded as a nascent revolution of ownership, anchored by the Gibraltar-like certainty of cryptographic private keys. “We know this technology will matter in the future, because a lot of humanity, if not all of humanity, will own digital items,” he says. “It’s just like it was in 2008, when people said not everyone would have a smartphone.” He also respected the business model—Ledger sold actual devices, not dicey promises of perpetually rising markets. Private wallets embodied for him the decentralized ethos at the core of the crypto vision. “The people at this company wouldn’t work at Coinbase,” says Rogers. “They don’t want to work at a bank. They believe in self-custody.”Still, Rogers wanted to do his due diligence. Fadell, a parent friend from his children’s school in Paris, took it upon himself to investigate. At that point Fadell was living a quiet life as an investor. During the first months of the pandemic it was a super quiet life. “Tony never crossed the fucking transom of his door,” Rogers says. Fadell was busy giving product advice to the companies he funded and writing a business book that drew on his career, a pursuit usually signifying a career’s end. But Rogers had gotten him curious, so he took a hard look at what the company considered its biggest strength—its security. Fadell’s guide to Ledger’s operations was its chief technology officer, Charles Guillemet, who joined the company in 2017. Inside its headquarters, behind a giant medieval-style door off a Paris lane, Guillemet created the Donjon, a jacked-up security lab that verifies the resilience of every aspect of the hardware, down to the chip circuits. Inside the Donjon, motherboards get probed as if in a 21st-century version of Frankenstein’s lab. Lasers connected to oven-sized oscilloscopes poke at chips to observe how they might fail. Guillemet told Fadell he was appalled at the idea of people securing their assets on laptops or iPhones, which he deemed hopelessly vulnerable. He despised fingerprints and facial recognition. Your biometrics are public, after all, and can be counterfeited. The more time Fadell spent with Guillemet and the Ledger team, the more convinced he became. “I didn’t believe in all that crypto hype, but I believe in the technology,” he says. He told Rogers that Ledger was the real deal. Rogers became the company’s chief experience officer in January 2021, and later that year, to bolster the company’s storytelling acumen, he hired an editor in chief, former Vice executive Ariel Wengroff. She oversaw a crypto education project called Ledger Academy and kicked off a podcast and video series. Some of the engineers at Ledger didn’t understand why those nontechnical hires were necessary. Gauthier saw their resistance as part of Ledger’s problem. “I was saying we could sell tens of millions of devices, have billions of revenue, billions of valuation. And they were like, ‘Yeah, whatever.’”But Rogers’ most significant contribution might have been igniting the interest of his friend Fadell. He had seen a weakness in Ledger’s plan—the device itself was unlovable. To unlock the wallet, you had to enter a four- or eight-digit passcode using an incredibly awkward interface, like writing an essay on a home security panel. He began pondering what a better solution might be. Fadell met with Gauthier at a Paris café, and they agreed that Ledger needed its next product to have broader appeal. They parted ways, but Fadell kept brainstorming. When he hit on a vision, he met with Gauthier again. “I want to be the chief designer on that,” Fadell told him. Gauthier immediately agreed. FADELL STARTED THE gig full of ideas. As the guy who swept away the pain points of first-generation MP3 players (big and clunky, engineering degree required to select a song) and thermostats (ugly, no connectivity, impossible to program), Fadell was quick to understand the shortcomings of Ledger’s wallet. Its screen was tiny, it lacked a keyboard or keypad, and its appearance and charm were on par with an early-2000s USB stick. The startup instructions warned users to set aside a minimum of 30 minutes. In his mind, the wallet should be about the size of a credit card and have a touchscreen. The setup time should take no more than three minutes. You should be able to personalize the lock screen to display anything you want. He also envisioned people owning several wallets, one for each category of digital collecting or banking. He liked the concept of stacking them on top of each other, like a cash bundle of $100 bills. He came up with the idea of having magnets to snap the units into a tidy stack. That feature provided the name for the device: Stax. Fadell surveyed all possible electronic components, talked to suppliers, and began prototyping, using green plastic toy blocks and magnets. One design constraint was battery life—Fadell wanted people to be able to leave their wallets untouched for months and still have power when they retrieved them. That meant the screen had to use energy-efficient E Ink. (Color would have been nice, but the tech isn’t there yet.) Fadell took apart a bunch of Kindles and ReMarkable tablets to test how the screen might display a keyboard and other buttons.One of his dreams was to extend the screen along the edge of the unit, so people could label it. None of the E Ink displays he saw could do what he wanted, so he contacted an old friend, the UK venture capitalist Hermann Hauser, who had once been involved in an unsuccessful ebook device with advanced E Ink. That company, Plastic Logic, was now based in Dresden, Germany, and was making custom E Ink displays. And they could bend! The curved display had at that point been used only by an obscure Russian phone called the YotaPhone. Fadell wanted to produce hundreds of thousands of screens with a dramatically sharper curve and at a low cost.Adding a touchscreen to the wallet presented a risk, though—a sophisticated attacker could, with the right equipment, pick up electronic signals leaking through the screen and figure out the pin code that unlocks the device. So Ledger’s engineers had to shield the screen so it emitted no digital exhaust. They also wrote their own driver, the code that helps render pixels on the screen. “You’re compromising security if you use a driver written by someone in China that you’ve never met,” Rogers says.SUBSCRIBESubscribe to get access to Plaintext, a weekly newsletter on digital technology—who makes it and how it affects us.Meanwhile, Fadell was increasingly showing up at Ledger as the de facto lead of its new flagship product. (Though he never became an employee, Fadell says he was granted significant equity.) Not everyone welcomed him. Put magnets on a hardware wallet? Add a curved screen? From a supplier who’d never done that before? Plus, Fadell can be exacting to the point of infuriating. “I can’t tell you how many times they’d say, ‘Oh this seems difficult—a rolled screen?’” Fadell says. “And I’m like, ‘I’m telling you, we’re going to do this thing. How many times do I have to say, just trust me, it’s going to happen.’”Early on, Gauthier had to convene his engineers and quell a possible rebellion. “They were saying all those things had never been done before. And I’m like, shut the fuck up. If he says we’re going to do it, we’re going to do it.” Apparently, they bought in: Some of those engineers described Fadell’s style to me much the way he likes to be viewed—grueling, but inspiring. Like his former boss Steve Jobs. (Maybe if I spoke French I could have cornered them and gotten more candor.)Ledger saw other benefits of having Fadell onboard. Early in 2022, Foxconn, the manufacturing giant that Ledger retained to assemble the Stax units, said that it wasn’t going to meet its February 2023 deadline for shipping final products. Maybe June? “We were freaking out,” Gauthier says. Fadell told him, “I got this.” He wrote to Foxconn’s CEO, explaining that the deadline was important and it would be a great favor if he looked into it. “Fifteen minutes later, boom, we were back on track,” Gauthier says.WHEN I ARRIVE in Paris in October, the first prototypes are finished, and the team is working out the remaining bugs. Sitting with Fadell and Wengroff in Rogers’ apartment in the Marais section—a fourth-floor walk-up accessible through an unmistakably Parisian courtyard—several units are neatly, um, stacked on the table, alongside a plate of fresh croissants. On the spine of one of them is the phrase, BANKS ARE DEAD. I watch as Rogers buys an NFT. He does the actual selection and transaction on a phone. The Stax wakes up when it’s time to verify Rogers’ private key, alerting him that a pending transaction awaits his verification. Punching in his passcode on the display—sheltering with a cupped hand so I can’t shoulder-surf—he buys it. Within a few minutes, he can view the image on his phone and edit it so it shows up in gray scale when he ships it to the lock screen of his Stax.It may be a stretch to imagine a mass movement toward crypto coins and digital goods. Ledger’s very long-term vision is that with secure, well-designed hardware as a bedrock, people will gravitate to crypto to verify their identity and credentials. Think driver’s licenses, passports, proof that you passed your dentistry boards, Taylor Swift tickets, and voter ID. Rogers says that when he attended the NFT NYC conference earlier this year and digitally verified he had the token required to register for exclusive events, an irony struck him. “The technology I use to get into parties is more secure, easier to use, and better than the technology that I use to get into our country! Fast-forward into the future and your government document is in your hardware wallet.” To advance this vision, Ledger has so far only met with consultants from Estonia, a nation known for embracing any futuristic scheme that comes its way. A delightful wallet can only do so much; it’s not going to win over people who struggle through 40,000-word crypto explainers in allegedly plain language and still can’t figure it out. Does Ledger really believe it can transform the industry?“That’s the hope,” Fadell says. “To have that iPod moment for digital assets. You can’t just integrate it into a phone, no matter how much you try. You need to have a real physical key in your life that holds the digital.” As we sit in Rogers’ sunny Paris flat, it all seems plausible. Less than a month later, the blockchain world would blow up at the hands of a bogus crypto king in the Bahamas.IN EARLY NOVEMBER, Gauthier, Rogers, Fadell, and Wengroff visited New York City, and we met in a downtown bistro. As the espressos were being pulled, I asked about the fuzzy-haired, short-pants elephant in the room. Only a week earlier, a young crypto magnate named Sam Bankman-Fried had presided over the biggest disaster in crypto since Mt. Gox. “SBF” had allegedly redirected a chunk of customer deposits from his multibillion-dollar crypto exchange FTX to cover the failing high-risk investments handled by a trading company he controlled. When customers went to withdraw their funds, some of them discovered they couldn’t. His crew had annihilated at least a billion dollars’ worth of wealth, stiffing more than a million customers and demolishing crypto’s reputation. The implosion capped off a convulsive year. The price of cryptocurrency has sunk, and NFTs have gone from galleries to Goodwill. Considering all this, launching Stax now could seem like introducing a new cocktail in the lounge of the Titanic, just as the ship smacked into the iceberg. “Non, non!” insist the folks at Ledger. They say that FTX has been a boon for their company. It was a vindication of self-custody. People who had been holding their digital assets inside exchanges were now pulling out their funds and moving them to hardware wallets. The previous day, a Sunday, Ledger had set a sales record, and now it was on track to break it again. As customers poured in—and existing users who hadn’t fired up their wallets in months suddenly decided to update the firmware—Ledger’s servers were temporarily swamped, and for an hour or so, customers couldn’t update their software. Some got spooked. The company’s support team sent out an ill-worded message assuring everyone, in a tweet, “Your assets are safe.” Of course they were—that’s what self-custody is all about. But after SBF and other meltdowns, that phrase had become a signal that a house of cards was falling and your assets were gone. If even savvy crypto folk get panicky at a hiccup like that, just imagine the reluctance of Web3 holdouts. Might it be unrealistic for Ledger to expect newbies to pay almost $300 for a wallet that has a cool picture on it but still depends on a somewhat impenetrable ecosystem and an existential question of reliability?To the Ledger-ites, the promise of crypto and the necessity of self-custody will prevail. It’s a logical outcome of the last half-century of atoms moving to bits. Still, Rogers admits that no matter how slick Stax is, it interacts with systems that have massive barriers to entry. After breakfasting at the bistro, I spent an hour with him trying to get set up to trade crypto and buy NFTs. While getting the wallet to authenticate me was easy, getting the currency needed to buy the funky artworks Rogers likes proved frustratingly difficult, and apparently impossible to complete in the time we had. “Crypto is where the internet was in 1993,” he finally said, in a tone somewhere between wistful and pissed off. That doesn’t bother him too much—the iPod, after all, came out in the early, awkward days of digital music and took a few years to catch on. “The only question in my brain is, are we the Apple of Web3?” Rogers says. “Or are we the BlackBerry or Nokia of Web3?” We’ve already seen the FTX of Web3, so there’s nowhere to go but up.

In December 2021, Adobe announced it would be removing Pantone colors from its app. Why that happened was never certain; rumors spread that it was over the cost of including Pantone in Adobe software, while Pantone publicly said that it felt Adobe wasn’t keeping pace with the plethora of new colors it released. Adobe’s chief product officer, Scott Belsky, has tweeted that Pantone asked Adobe to remove the colors, “as they want to charge customers directly.”Scores of Photoshop and Illustrator users who have used certain Pantone color collections in their works have recently been confronted with the fallout of a disagreement between Adobe and Pantone. The result? Where once there were vibrant hues there is now only the color black.The change is the latest twist in a long-running dispute between the design software giant and the color-standard-setting organization. In December 2021, Adobe announced it would be removing Pantone colors from its app. Why that happened was never certain; rumors spread that it was over the cost of including Pantone in Adobe software, while Pantone publicly said that it felt Adobe wasn’t keeping pace with the plethora of new colors it released. Adobe’s chief product officer, Scott Belsky, has tweeted that Pantone asked Adobe to remove the colors, “as they want to charge customers directly.”The Pantone block was meant to be implemented earlier this year, but it appears Adobe has finally pulled the plug—unless users are willing to pay $15 a month for a license for Pantone color books. The latest shift has prompted a social media outcry among the design community. “I was really upset by it, because I’ve been using Pantone in my work for about 20 years,” says UK-based artist Stuart Semple. “I pay a fortune for the [Adobe] software suite,” he adds.Semple’s studio has multiple licenses to the Adobe Creative Cloud, the suite of design apps from the company behind Photoshop and Illustrator, which moved to a subscription model in 2012 after decades as a single-purchase, permanent ownership product. It’s part of a broader shift across many industries toward upselling segments of products and switching to time-limited loans of content that first started with audio streaming and downloads.Semple—who disliked Adobe's shift to a subscription-first product—also fears that this latest move to charge for Pantone colors will make it harder for young artists with less disposable income to use what is an important set of color palettes for anyone who wants to produce a printed product. “They’re literally holding the colors hostage,” he says. “You have to pay or you can’t see your work.”Adobe spokesperson Erin Di Leva says that the company is “currently looking at ways to lessen the impact on our customers.” Iain Pike, senior global director of product and licensing at Pantone, says the company does not “determine the pricing, features, or user experience” offered by companies that use its color library, but that it collaborates with such companies “to create the best possible customer experience.”Aaron Perzanowski, coauthor of The End of Ownership, researches intellectual and personal property law at the University of Michigan Law School. He says the standoff shows “how the shift from products to services erodes consumer ownership and puts us at the mercy of largely unaccountable companies.” He adds that Pantone has no underlying intellectual property rights when it comes to either individual colors, or the color libraries of which they are a part. “There’s no copyright protection available for individual colors, and the limited trademark rights for specific colors don’t apply here either,” Perzanowski says.Semple’s anger is typical of the design community. “They’ve done it in the worst way possible,” says Laura Sofia Heimann, a designer and developer from Germany, who reverse engineered how she thinks Adobe plans to lock out users from utilizing Pantone color swatches—and therefore any potential routes that designers and users could follow to try and subvert the blocks.Over the course of a weekend, Heimann probed how Adobe’s software reads the Pantone color palette. Her snap conclusion is that the company has measures in place to recognize whenever any Pantone color has been used in a file at any point in time. And when it finds that reference, it switches the colors to black.Heimann believes it’s possible for users to work around this by removing any Pantone colors from the swatches used in files, then saving them again—avoiding their files going black. Removing the Pantone colors from a file’s swatches converts them to traditional, non-Pantone colors. “If you're not using the Pantone presets for color fidelity, you can remove the Pantone presets from your file to convert them to normal colors,” says Heimann.The problem is that most people who use Pantone colors use them because printers worldwide standardize the production of colors by using Pantone profiles. “I make a lot of screenprints,” says Semple. “I need a reliable reference for my printers to ensure we’re both talking about the same color.” And right now there’s no real alternative solution. It’s an industry standard. “I can have a manufacturer in the Far East making something and say, ‘The blue is 660c,’ and they know what I’m talking about,” says Semple, referring to the Pantone code for a Facebook-style blue color. “That’s the whole point.”Yet Semple is keen to see if it’s possible to shun Pantone’s library of colors entirely. On October 28, he released Freetone, a collection of 1,280 colors that mimic Pantone’s and can be installed into Adobe software as a plugin. Semple, on his online store, is careful to not say they’re exact one-to-one replacements of Pantone colors, only that they’re “extremely Pantoneish” alternatives that are arguably “indistinguishable” from the real ones. In the four days since its release, Freetone has been downloaded more than 22,000 times—vindication, Semple says, of how users feel about their access to Pantone colors being taken away from them.Yet there’s uncertainty about where exactly the blame lies. “I think it’s about putting more pressure on Pantone to make a deal,” says Heimann. Adobe’s Di Leva did not respond to a query about why the company had implemented the block in the way it did. “We operate in a world in which the products and services we rely on are not ours to use independently,” says Perzanowski. “They are tethered to companies like Adobe, Apple, and Tesla—who get to dictate how we use them through a combination of software code, license terms, and legal threats.”However, as well as adding pressure to Pantone, the decision sacrifices user convenience and experience. “As a designer, it makes everything more complicated,” says Heimann. “It makes handoff to other companies and other departments much more difficult, and adds more barriers for design work.” Heimann points out that the issue throws up barriers that Pantone came into existence to try and avoid: the need to be physically present at a print company in order to check that the end result matches the design.She also says Adobe needs to take its fair share of the blame for the situation. “Adobe could easily add a button that converts the colors,” she says—pointing out that she has moved around and deleted the colors in the file. “There’s nothing preventing them. Them not adding that, to me, is an indicator that Adobe is trying to create a public outburst at Pantone for doing this, so they have a better deal.” Heimann feels it’s wrong for users to be dragged into the despute. “If Adobe and Pantone have a disagreement, and I have my files changed because of that, it’s a little bit weird.”","is the latest twist in a long-running dispute between the design software giant and the color-standard-setting organization. in December 2021, Adobe announced it would be removing Pantone colors from its app. Why that happened was never certain; rumors spread that it was over the cost of including Pantone in Adobe software."
gear,https://www.wired.com/story/verso-cosmo-guitar-is-made-from-bent-steel/,This Designer Guitar Is Made From a Bent Sheet of Steel,Jeremy White,"BY MICHAEL CALORERather than a lump of wood, the Cosmo's body is a carefully bent sheet of powder-coated steel. This ergonomic shape not only houses the necessary circuitry to make the guitar work, it also allows an innovative approach to the placement of the pickups, transducers that capture the strings' mechanical vibrations and convert them to electrical signals that can then be amplified and played through a loudspeaker. Pickups are usually screwed in place on a guitar's body, but where they are placed affects the tone of the sound created. This is why you see multiple pickups in different locations on, say, a Fender Stratocaster or a Les Paul. Stummvoll has made his pickups mobile so they can be moved around and placed where the player chooses. ""This was a happy accident,"" explains Stummvoll. ""It wasn't the intention."" As pickups are magnetic, they naturally clamp themselves to the surface of the Cosmo's metal body. Realizing the potential benefits of this in terms of versatility of sound, Stummvoll made it a feature. You can watch and listen to some YouTube demos of this changing sound.""It has its own character and sound, a very warm and resonant tone with lots of harmonic content, but it's nothing weird or strange,"" Stummvoll says. ""I would say it's somewhere between electric guitar and an acoustic, because you have these added overtones—but more towards electric."" Along with the $1,781 (€1,710) Cosmo and the brand's Gravis bass guitar, Stummvoll has now released his latest creation, the $1,935 (€1,860) Orbit, a baritone guitar. As well as featuring Verso's signature movable pickups, Stummvoll says the Orbit's long 28.5-inch (720-mm) scale gives this instrument precise and gritty bass response in standard B to B or A to A tunings, while that added length also apparently brings plenty of sustain.Stummvoll also claims that the Orbit's “natural microphonic effect is less pronounced than on Cosmo, which makes it even more suitable to distorted sounds.” Metal fans, take note.","the Cosmo and Gravis bass guitar, Stummvoll has released his latest creation, the $1,935 (€1,860) Orbit.

The discarded peel is added to a biopolymeric base derived from vegetable starches, which can then be used for 3D printing. However, not content to stick with one citrus fruit, the company has now adapted its material to use Mediterranean lemons. The first three items made with the bright yellow biopolymer are a magazine rack, a wall clock and, naturally, a fruit bowl. Not forgetting its orangey origins, Krill has also added two more items to its Ribera collection: Metho, a totemic modular desk organizer, and Hidee, an open vase with a concave shape that makes inserted flower stems appear to vanish. Not only do these items look and smell appealing (yes, each has the natural aroma of the fruit from which it's made), every product offsets approximately 1 kilogram of CO2. $68 (€65) and up at Krill Design.Pierre Murot U1 Wall LampPierre Murot is an industrial designer who graduated from Paris’ ENSCI-Les Ateliers and École Boulle. His work explores new ways to work with often forgotten natural materials, repurposing them in distinct and contemporary ways. At Salone, he was exhibiting a project that looks for innovative ways to work with clay, tweaking the artisanal extrusion process in order to create modern functional items. His original research project, carried out on site at a traditional clay brickyard in the Dordogne region of France, has led to a series of pieces, including these deceptively simple, richly textured LED wall lights, as well as a collection of modular storage units that remind me of our student days, building shelves from scaffolding planks and breeze blocks, albeit with a lot more class. $TBD from Pierre MurotCyryl Zakrzewski Noise SideboardMany products exhibited at Salone 2022 attempt to use recycled plastic to make something aesthetically pleasing. Some efforts are more successful than others, such as this piece from Polish designer Cyryl Zakrzewski, who believes that “plastic should now be considered a luxury material.” Looking more like a topological map than a piece of living-room furniture, Zakrzewski's 6-foot-long Noise sideboard is made entirely from recycled plastic, which is CNC milled to create its signature waveform panels. Part of the designer's Continuum collection, the synthetic material—made with the help of Boomplastic, a Polish collective that has created its own mill injectors and machines to enable effective small-scale plastic recycling—is intended to look like natural stone until you get up close and the true nature of the sideboard's structure becomes obvious. $TBD from Cyryl ZakrzewskiProstoria Rostrum and Sabot SofasModularity was big news at the show, with countless brands unveiling products that can be tuned, tweaked, expanded, and upgraded to suit your needs and space.

That’s the job of companies such as Joby, Lilium and Supernal, all of which have functional test aircraft and are progressing through regulatorary certification. Instead, Urban-Air Port was demonstrating a key bit of infrastructure and also working out how to squeeze in retail space and make boarding and disembarking as hassle-free as possible. And that includes how long passengers would have to queue to get a latte. “We thought the café was going to be way too big,” Sandhu says. “But it was exactly the right size.”For a month in a central Coventry car park, thousands of visitors wandered Air One, Urban-Air Port’s 1,700-square-meter modular popup building. In many ways it resembled any other transport hub—apart from the take-off platform which rose out of the center of its roof. While some services were up and running— including the café—the only aircraft taking off were delivery drones, though Hyundai’s Supernal eVTOL (electric vertical takeoff and landing) vehicle was on display.The aim wasn’t to prove that air taxis are the future of urban transport. That’s the job of companies such as Joby, Lilium and Supernal, all of which have functional test aircraft and are progressing through regulatorary certification. Instead, Urban-Air Port was demonstrating a key bit of infrastructure and also working out how to squeeze in retail space and make boarding and disembarking as hassle-free as possible. And that includes how long passengers would have to queue to get a latte. “We thought the café was going to be way too big,” Sandhu says. “But it was exactly the right size.”Contrary to dreams of flying cars, eVTOLs won’t initially—or likely ever—land in the street in front of your house. That would disrupt traffic, be dangerous and noisy. For one, most eVTOL designs are simply too large—the Lilium Jet has a 14-meter wingspan, 2 meters wider than a standard single-lane road. Instead, to hail an “air taxi,” passengers will need to make their way to a local vertiport, which could sit atop train stations, office blocks, or even float in water.Figuring out exactly what these buildings will require isn’t simple. Urban-Air worked with Coventry University on a virtual reality model to test the space before spending 11 weeks assembling Air One. Companies making eVTOLs, including German air-taxi startup Volocopter, have also released their own visions for what a vertiport might include, usually featuring glossy computer renders of shiny white lounges atop skyscrapers. Such designs might look futuristic, but they will likely be a logistical nightmare, with queuing, boarding, and recharging all much harder on the 70th floor than on terra firma.Paul Hermans, an airport planner at engineering and design consultancy Arup, worked with both Urban-Air Port and Volocopter to develop vertiport designs. His starting point for a building for vehicles that aren’t yet in the air and a market that doesn’t yet exist is simple: Start with regulation. Any port for aviation will be as heavily regulated as an airport or helipad, so looking at the rules around both can help inform a vertiport’s requirements; plus, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has released draft regulations for vertiports, so sticking to that document is a good starting place.On the technical side, any vertiport has a few key physical requirements: a stable electric grid for fast recharging, a hangar for maintenance and a system to move vehicles into it, and enough room around the takeoff and landing pad for the aircraft to maneuver. While Urban-Air Port’s design has a moving platform to lift vehicles to the roof of the building, Hermans explains that vertiports will require less clearance than helicopters, which land a lot less vertically than most of us imagine—eVTOLs, by comparison, do, as the name suggests, actually take off vertically. “That allows you, in your vertiport design, to start to integrate them into much denser urban environments where helicopters might not be able to operate,” says Hermans.While computer renders of vertiports often place them atop buildings, that would require passengers to have access to a lift to the top, and many building managers will not be keen on letting random members of the public inside. Tower rooftops also often house building equipment such as lift mechanisms and air conditioning ducting, leaving a relatively small footprint to place a vertiport. Sure, it might be fine for a single vehicle, but a financially viable vertiport is likely to require space for multiple vehicles.Though some wealthy private companies may offer their staff rides in air taxis as a perk, Hermans predicts public vertiports are more likely to be sited atop lower buildings, such as car parks—and this is why Sandhu spent three weeks in a Coventry car park next to a train station. “The challenge is getting aircraft into compact, dense locations,” he says—and, crucially, as close as possible to other transport infrastructure.There’s another reason lower vertiports have merit: They take less time to board. Urban-Air placed its OneAir port in a car park next to a train station to make it faster and easier to access. Had it been on top of a building, passengers would add extra time to their journey. On the other hand, the more centrally located vertiports are, and the lower to the ground they are, the higher the risk of crashes and noise.That’s the physical side of vertiports. On the passenger side, it’s unclear whether security will be similar to airports or train stations—and reducing time-consuming queues and checks matters for a market that is betting on quick trips. “If you’re spending 10 minutes going through security for a flight that only lasts five minutes, that doesn’t really stack up all that well,” Hermans says.Of course, airports aren’t just about travel—like it or not they’re about shopping too. To work out how to best make use of the space available, Urban-Air Port worked with duty free experts from Qatar Airways on the design of the retail areas. “The key thing was having brands showcase some of their products in a very small footprint,” Sandhu says.It may seem a bit early to be fine-tuning space for lattes and retail—after all, none of the eVTOLs are yet approved by regulators, let alone in mass production. But the industry needs to start considering infrastructure before air taxis are ready to fly. “If you make an airplane, you don’t have to worry about where it’s going to go,” says Sergio Cecutta, of transport analyst firm SMG Consulting. “We don’t want to get into a catch-22 situation where there are no vehicles, so there’s no infrastructure. We need to do it at the same time.”And getting the timing right is no easy task, with “flying car” startups consistently missing their own deadlines. Right now, even aircraft being trialed can’t go into production without regulatory approval—which puts punchy promises of air-taxi services by 2024 firmly in the hands of the US Federal Aviation Administration and the EASA.SMG Consulting tracks vehicle development, rating Joby and Volocopter as being “highly likely” to hit that deadline; plenty of the other two-dozen rivals on its list aren’t winning quite as much confidence. SMG also tracks infrastructure readiness, but of the five companies it follows, none are expected to have a port before 2024. In short, a lot is going to happen in 2024, or nothing at all. “In 2021, people realized eVTOLS are real,” Cecutta says. “So 2022 will be us realizing we’ve got to start building stuff.”Plus, the benefit of eVTOLs is that they can land basically anywhere—certainly anywhere a helicopter can. So rather than racing to install vertiports, operators can use existing aviation infrastructure. Lilium vice-chairman Alex Asseily says the company is already considering how its electric aircraft could cover routes in Florida with partner NetJets. That could involve, he says by way of example, a route linking West Palm Beach Airport with an existing urban heliport. “We can land at a standard heliport. The only thing you’d need to add to it would be a charger,” he says.All the Lilium Jet really needs is a “parking spot” and a charger in order to land, suggesting that installing full vertiports for every destination may be unnecessary in the early stages. “What we’re trying to do is not be restricted, to not be forced to invest huge amounts on day one,” Asseily says. “None of this infrastructure takes a long time to build—building a slab of concrete which an aircraft can land on with a supercharger isn’t easy, but it’s quick.”",", but it was exactly the right size.

Last month, Russian police coerced protesters into unlocking their phones to search for evidence of dissent, leading to arrests and fines. What’s worse is that Telegram, one of the main chat-based apps used in Russia, is vulnerable to these searches. Even just having the Telegram app on a personal device might imply that its owner doesn’t support the Kremlin’s war. But the builders of Telegram have failed to design the app with considerations for personal safety in high-risk environments, and not just in the Russian context. Telegram can thus be weaponized against its users.Likewise, amid the back and forth about Elon Musk’s plan to buy Twitter, many people who use the platform have expressed concerns over his bid to forefront algorithmic content moderation and other design changes on the whim of his $44 billion fancy.

With the projected criminalization of those seeking or providing abortion services, it has become more and more apparent that the tools and technologies most used for accessing vital health care data are insecure and dangerous.The same steps could protect users in all these contexts. If the builders of these tools had designed their apps by focusing on safety in high-risk environments—for persons who are often seen as the more “extreme” or “edge” cases and therefore ignored—the weaponization that users fear would not be possible, or at the very least they would have tools to manage their risk.The reality is that making better, safer, less harmful tech requires design based on the lived realities of those who are most marginalized. These “edge cases” are frequently ignored as being outside of the scope of a typical user’s likely experiences. Yet they are powerful indicators for understanding the flaws in our technologies.This is why I refer to these cases—of people, groups, and communities who are the most impacted and least supported—as “decentered.” The decentered are the most marginalized and often most criminalized. By understanding and establishing who is most impacted by distinct social, political, and legal frameworks, we can understand who would most likely be a victim of the weaponization of certain technologies. And, as an added benefit, technology which has recentered the extremes will always be generalizable to the broader usership.

We explored the lived experiences of queer persons who faced police persecution as a result of using specific personal technologies. Take the experience of a queer Syrian refugee in Lebanon who was stopped at a police or army check point for papers. They had their phone arbitrarily searched. The icon for a queer app, Grindr, is seen, and the officer determines the person is queer. Other areas of the refugee’s phone are then checked, revealing what is deemed as “queer content.” The refugee is taken in for further interrogation and subjected to verbal and physical abuse. They now face sentencing under Article 534 of the Lebanese Penal Code and face potential imprisonment, fines, and/or revocation of their immigration status in Lebanon. This is one case among many.But what if this logo was hidden, and an app indicating an individual’s sexuality was not readily available to them? While still letting the individual keep the app and connection to other queer people? Based on the research and collaboration with the Guardian Project, Grindr worked to implement a stealth mode on its product.The company also implemented our other recommendations with similar success. Changes such as the Discreet App Icon allowed users to have the app appear as a common utility, such as a calendar or calculator. So, in an initial police search, users can bypass that risk of being outed by the content or visuals of the apps they own. While this feature was created solely based on the outcomes of extreme cases, such as the queer Syrian refugee, it proved popular with users globally. Indeed, it became so popular that it went from being fully available only in “high risk” countries to being available internationally for free in 2020, along with the popular PIN feature that was also introduced under this project. This was the first time a dating app took such radical security measures for its users; many of Grindr’s competitors followed suit.After the success of the Discreet App Icon, and based on the recommendations from the project, Grindr introduced a variety of new features—such as unsending messages, ephemeral photos, screenshot blocking, and contextualized safety guides—in late 2019 and 2020, and focused on harm reduction for all users. These changes are now utilized by users worldwide, from New York to São Paulo, Brazil. Earlier this year, WhatsApp adopted changes for its 2 billion users that centered the harm faced by the queer community in the Middle East and North Africa. These changes are based on my recent report documenting the use of digital evidence against LGBTQ people in Tunisia, Lebanon, and Egypt. Both companies report that these changes caused a positive shift in user engagement with these features specifically, as well as with the app as a whole.These are all examples of what I call designing from the margins, or how building new communication technologies needs to be done by directly centering highly marginalized and criminalized communities. (My report—Design From The Margins: Centering the Most Marginalized and Impacted in Design Processes, From Ideation to Production*—*has just been published.) We need to radically shift how we are building our technologies if we have any chance at mitigating further harms.Going back to Telegram, Elon Musk’s Twitter plans, and the impending threats to abortion access and safety: If these apps’ security protocols were learning from experiences of decentered people in highly policed and risky contexts, Telegram could have had discreet app icons to avoid it from being an admission of guilt in the eyes of the Russian police, or it could have implemented a more robust disappearing-messages structure that could protect against device checks. It also could have built safer channels to avoid threats to administrators in high risk contexts (as Telegram could have learned from incidents in Iran).Likewise, if Twitter understood the risks faced by communities living under surveillance and built products for them, it would have moved to encrypting DMs end-to-end, which would prevent Musk (or anyone else within Twitter) from having easy access (especially with increasing concerns due to Musk’s worrisome partnerships). But as of today, that technology has not been rolled out, and it’s impossible to truly delete DMs.As with Musk’s vague nods at quashing anonymity: If Twitter had learned from groups and communities who have to remain anonymous to exist, it would have pushed for more nuanced, practical, and less data-invasive strategies to protect against fake profiles while also protecting vulnerable people from privacy breaches, especially those who live under dictatorships. Take the learnings from Egypt: We know Egyptian police use fake online profiles to entrap and arrest queer people and use what is found on their phones as evidence in court. Yet most queer people in a context where their identity is criminalized need to remain anonymous while connecting online. Their ask is for companies to better detect entrapers without creating more risks for the community’s safety: It’s the imperative of companies and experts to find this middle ground without squashing those most impacted. Progress on this can be made only when companies center experiences that highlight gaps in designs from all angles.As for Dobbs v. Jackson: In 2021, the Digital Defence Fund outlined the needed steps for online safety for folks to avoid putting themselves at risk with a trove of digital footprints when seeking abortion support. Experts have rightly pointed out that the major threat isn’t solely data collection via period-tracking apps, but also fake clinics and police device searches. And those who will be most impacted are, of course, communities of color, LGBTQ people, sex workers, and highly disenfranchised communities. If the tools had been built with their cases in mind, with some foresight of the risks and their weaponization, they could have avoided a mass exodus of users (as we’re seeing with period-tracking apps) but also remained as go-to resources in a time of dire need. These shifts and changes could protect those who need it most in such a turbulent time, and also make the tools pioneers among their competitors.No small fixes can address the larger and deeply rooted structural issues that foreground how these technologies are deployed or weaponized. However, in centering, consulting, and understanding the legal, social, and political issues that impact decentered and marginalized groups, some protections can be provided. Reimagining the importance of cases that deviate from the so-called typical technology user and placing them at the center of the design process is not a revolutionary concept. It's a core basis for many industries. In terms of safety and security, it should be seen as a corporate responsibility in developing tech. As one of the Tunisian lawyers from the Digital Crime Scenes report frames it. “We are in your application, you must protect us,” and when you do, you’re protecting all of us. It is no longer advisable to design technologies without designing directly for those who are most harmed. In fact, technology is better, safer, more innovative, more robust, and more integrative of privacy when those most marginalized are centered from the start of the development process. So the question isn’t can it be done, but rather why isn’t it being done?",", risks and harms to highly marginalized people leads to proclamations of “authenticating all humans”. Bringing in recommendations from someone with no framework of risk leads to proclamations of “authenticating all humans”. lack of safety infrastructure is hitting home hard in the US since the leak of the draft Supreme Court’s opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson."

It made him uncomfortable—how would that affect Lyft’s drivers?—but his managers reminded him that they needed to focus on profitability. Then, in 2020, the company spent millions fighting a ballot initiative that would reclassify its drivers as employees. “I had some concern around that,” says Read, who noticed that Lyft was advertising against the proposition in its own app. Eventually, he decided his values weren’t aligned with the company’s. He left at the end of 2020.Read had joined Lyft as a senior software engineer in May 2019, expecting to make a difference in the world. The ride-sharing company was preparing to fully electrify its vehicle fleet by 2030, and Read’s team, which managed the fleet, would help to make that possible. “It felt more values-oriented than some of my past roles in tech,” he says. “It was like, if I turn this knob, it has an impact.”Later that year, Lyft went public, and Read’s team upped the pricing of its car-rental program. It made him uncomfortable—how would that affect Lyft’s drivers?—but his managers reminded him that they needed to focus on profitability. Then, in 2020, the company spent millions fighting a ballot initiative that would reclassify its drivers as employees. “I had some concern around that,” says Read, who noticed that Lyft was advertising against the proposition in its own app. Eventually, he decided his values weren’t aligned with the company’s. He left at the end of 2020.It was around that time that Read started asking himself the big existential questions: Who am I? What have I been doing with my life? Being an engineer was part of his identity, but so was being in touch with social and environmental issues. He took some time off, considered going back to school, and wondered whether there was a place for him in tech. Then a few months ago, while Googling around for answers, Read discovered an online course that seemed poised to answer all of these questions: the Foundations of Humane Technology.The course, which comes out of beta today, was developed by the Center for Humane Technology. The nonprofit’s purpose has mainly been to give language to the uneasiness around technology’s impact on society, popularizing terms like “time well spent” (a metric to replace engagement on screens) and “human downgrading” (to describe the cumulative negative effect of technology on peoples’ cognition). The organization’s cofounder is Tristan Harris, an ex-Googler who called attention to the search giant’s extractive features in 2013. He has since left the industry and made a career out of rehabilitating it.On the Center for Humane Technology’s website, Read saw a few of its recent projects, including the 2020 Netflix documentary The Social Dilemma, which memified the idea that “if you're not paying for the product, then you are the product.” Then he clicked to learn more about the course on offer, marketed to technologists who wanted to “treat attention and intention as sacred, protect well-being, minimize unforeseen consequences, and ultimately build our collective capacity to address the most urgent challenges facing humanity.” Read was intrigued, and unemployed. He enrolled.Most of the Center for Humane Technology’s work to date has focused on identifying the big problems in tech. But after The Social Dilemma aired, Randima Fernando, the center’s executive director, says a wave of people in the tech industry approached him and demanded solutions. “They were like, great, I get it, we’re worried. What do we do now?”The new course is meant, in part, to answer that question, speaking directly to rehabilitated techies like Read. It contains eight modules and is intended to take about eight hours total, plus additional time spent on worksheets, reflection exercises, and optional discussion groups over Zoom. Read, who “binged” the course, says he completed it in about two weeks.“If you have the business model breathing down your back,” she says, “it’s going to impact what you do.”SUPARNA CHHIBBER, FORMER AMAZON EMPLOYEEFor people who have spent years studying the harmful externalities of the tech industry, the course might feel short on insight. Yes, social media companies exploit human weaknesses—what’s new? But for those just arriving to those ideas, it provides some useful jumping off points. One module focuses on the psychology of persuasive tech and includes a “humane design guide” for creating more respectful products. Another encourages technologists to identify their highest values and the ways those values interact with their work. At the end of the lesson, a worksheet invites them to imagine sipping tea at age 70, looking back on their life. “What’s the career you look back on? What are the ways you’ve influenced the world?”Subtle? Not exactly. Even still, Fernando believes the tech industry is so badly in need of a wake-up call that these worksheets and journal prompts might give tech workers a moment to consider what they’re building. Suparna Chhibber, who left a job at Amazon in 2020, says the pace of the tech industry doesn't always leave room for people to reflect on their purpose or values. “People get paid a lot to push things through, and if you’re not doing that, then you’re basically failing,” she says.Chhibber enrolled in the Foundations of Humane Technology around the same time as Read and found a community of like-minded people waiting to discuss the material over Zoom. (The Center for Humane Technology leads the sessions, and plans to continue them.) Read described these sessions like group therapy: “You get to know people who you feel safe exploring these topics with. You can open up.” Critically, it reminded him that, although many people don’t understand why he left his prestigious job, he is not alone.The Center for Humane Technology is not the first organization to make a tool kit for concerned tech workers. The Tech and Society Solutions Lab has released two, in 2018 and 2020, designed to encourage more ethical conversations within tech companies and startups. But the center’s new course is novel in the way that it tries to create community out of the burgeoning “humane tech” movement. A single concerned engineer is unlikely to change a company’s business model or practices. Together, though, a group of concerned engineers might make a difference.The Center for Humane Technology says that more than 3,600 tech workers have already started the course, and several hundred have completed it. “This is by far the biggest effort we’ve made to convene humane technologists,” says David Jay, the center’s head of mobilization. The center says it has amassed a long list of concerned technologists over the years and plans to promote the course directly to them. It also plans to get the word out through a few partner organizations and through its “allies inside of a wide range of technology companies, including many of the major social media platforms.”If there ever was a moment for the tech industry to band together and reconstitute its values, it would be now: Tech workers are in high demand, and companies are increasingly at the whim of their desires. Still, workers who have tried to raise flags haven’t always been listened to. It seems unlikely that these companies will reorient their business incentives—away from profits and toward social consciousness—without greater pressures, like regulation. Chhibber, who says she tried to infuse “humane tech” principles into her teams at Amazon, didn’t find that it was enough to change the company’s overall culture. “If you have the business model breathing down your back,” she says, “it’s going to impact what you do.”The last module of Foundations of Humane Technology tries to address this, with a lesson called “Changing the Culture of Technology.” It encourages tech workers to find collaborators, start with small changes, and push for new definitions of “success” in their work. It also asks them to reflect on a worksheet they filled out earlier in the course, which measured “the gap between your life today and what you most care about and believe.”But for many tech workers, that gap may be too large to close. It’s no surprise that some of the industry’s loudest critics, including Tristan Harris, have decided to leave big tech altogether. Those who try to reform it from within often get swept aside. For Read, who plans to enroll in a master’s program in design engineering this fall, there wasn’t an obvious way to continue working ethically in tech. Rather than inspire him to get another tech job, the Foundations of Humane Technology reminded him which “side of history” he wanted to be on.More Great WIRED Stories📩 The latest on tech, science, and more: Get our newsletters!Driving while baked?

science,https://www.wired.com/story/how-do-you-design-a-better-hospital-start-with-the-light/,How Do You Design a Better Hospital? Start With the Light,Sara Harrison,"In the 19th century, famed nurse Florence Nightingale popularized the pavilion plan, which featured wards: big rooms with long rows of beds, large windows, lots of natural light, and plenty of cross-ventilation. These designs were informed by the theory that dank indoor spaces spread disease. But wards offered almost no privacy for patients and required plenty of space, something that became difficult to find in increasingly dense cities. They also meant a lot of walking for nurses, who had to trudge up and down the aisles.“Part of the best care might be keeping people calm, giving them space to be alone—things that might seem frivolous but are really important,” says Annmarie Adams, a professor at McGill University who studies the history of hospital architecture.In the 19th century, famed nurse Florence Nightingale popularized the pavilion plan, which featured wards: big rooms with long rows of beds, large windows, lots of natural light, and plenty of cross-ventilation. These designs were informed by the theory that dank indoor spaces spread disease. But wards offered almost no privacy for patients and required plenty of space, something that became difficult to find in increasingly dense cities. They also meant a lot of walking for nurses, who had to trudge up and down the aisles.Over the next century, that focus on natural light faded in favor of prioritizing sterile spaces that would limit the spread of germs and accommodate a growing raft of medical equipment. After World War I, the new norm was to cluster patients’ rooms around a nurses’ station. These designs were easier on nurses, who no longer had to trek long corridors, and they were cheaper to heat and build. But they retained some of the trappings of older-style residential treatment facilities, like sanatoria where patients would convalesce for long periods of time; both mimicked fancy hotels with ornate lobbies and fine food, measures intended to convince middle-class people that “they were better off in hospitals than at home when seriously ill,” Adams wrote in a 2016 article on hospital architecture for the Canadian Medical Association Journal. This design, she argued, was meant to give people faith in the institution: “a tool of persuasion, rather than healing.”In the late 1940s and 1950s, hospitals transformed again, this time becoming office-like buildings without frills or many features meant to improve the experience of being there. “It was really designed to be operational and efficient,” says Jessie Reich, director of patient experience and magnet programs for the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. Many of these rooms had no windows at all, she points out.By the middle of the 20th century, the hospital had become sort of the opposite of what Florence Nightingale had envisioned, and many of those buildings, or ones modeled after them, are still in use today. “The typical hospital is designed as a machine for delivering care, but not as a place for healing,” says Sean Scensor, a principal at Safdie Architects, a firm that recently designed a hospital in Cartagena, Colombia. “I think what’s missing is the empathy for people as human beings.”Although Nightingale had been operating largely on anecdotal evidence that light and ventilation were important, she had been right—but it took over a century for scientists to gather the quantitative data to back her up. For example, a pivotal 1984 study published in Science followed patients after gallbladder surgery. The 25 patients whose rooms had views of greenery had shorter hospital stays and took fewer painkillers than the 23 patients whose windows faced a brick wall.Numerous recent studies show that exposure to nature and natural light can reduce pain, and that even a brief contact with the outdoors reduces stress. One 2019 study published in Frontiers in Psychology followed a group of 36 city dwellers for eight weeks and tested their saliva for biomarkers, including the stress hormone cortisol. The researchers found that spending just 20 minutes outside reduced people’s cortisol levels by over 20 percent. Another 2019 study found that taking regular breaks in outdoor gardens eased stress for ICU patients and their families. “The ambient environment influences our senses,” says Rana Zadeh, co-director and co-founder of the Health Design Innovations Lab at Cornell University. “The spatial environment influences how we can move and circulate. These are important in healthcare settings.”The same is true for psychiatric facilities, where design can help lower stress by reducing crowding and noise and increasing exposure to gardens and natural light. In one 2018 study published in the Journal of Environmental Psychology, researchers concluded that a Swedish hospital that used those design-based interventions lowered patient aggression so much that the staff decreased the use of physical restraints by 50 percent.Starting in the 1980s, Adams says, hospital designers began to shift away from favoring efficiency and office-like buildings and back towards light, open space, and positive patient experiences. Today, many buildings have large, central atria, similar to those at a mall or airport. Because that architecture is so familiar, Adams says, it makes the hospital less frightening and makes medical care feel more normal. “The hospital has come to look like a shopping mall or a spa,” she says. “It makes you feel like, ‘Oh, I’m just at the mall. I’m not really here for my cancer treatment.’”The Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania is one of the most recent examples of this trend in patient-centered design; in October, they opened a new pavilion to house the emergency department and in-patient care for the cardiology, neurology, neurosurgery, oncology, and transplant departments. “One of the things we know is that sleep is really, really critical to healing,” says Reich, who was one of many hospital employees who worked with the architects to finalize the design. So the new more-than-500-room building uses an “onstage/offstage” design to minimize noise and disruption. Private patient rooms are “onstage,” lining the outside of the building. Supply and medication rooms and staff break rooms are “offstage,” clustered in the core. Separating the two reduces noise and gives staff more private space, too. Each nursing specialty is now housed on the same floor, making it easier for nurses to coordinate care instead of having to travel between floors to consult about a patient.Every room also has a large window, which Reich says helps promote patients’ circadian rhythms, or sleep-wake patterns, “because it allows them to understand when it's day.” It’s also meant to prevent common hospital complications like delirium by giving patients a connection to the outside world that can help orient them in time and space.But not all design ideas end up being good solutions. When designing the new Centro Hospitalario Serena del Mar in Cartagena, the architects thought it would be great if patients were able to open their windows to get a breath of fresh air. “But there were practical issues,” says Scensor, whose firm designed the new building. Dust could get in and cause infections. Or the tropical humidity could wreak havoc on the hospital’s carefully-controlled environment.Instead, the firm chose windows that were giant, but sealed, prioritized greenery, and made the space easier to navigate. Scensor points out that when people enter hospitals, they’re often anxious and confused. But thoughtful design can help. Color coding or using different building materials to differentiate departments can make it easier for patients to find their way. Safdie Architects also designed an interior garden to help orient people in the building and provide a sense of calm, and reduced glare by using indirect lights that would be less harsh than overhead fluorescents. “It’s not about luxury or extravagance,” Scensor says. “It’s a basic thoughtfulness about people feeling cared for and respected.”But the trouble, says Adams, is that just providing open or green space isn’t a cure-all. People respond to spaces in different ways. In one 2010 study published in Social Science and Medicine, she examined how children and parents reacted to the atrium at the Hospital for Sick Kids in Toronto, Canada. Some families loved the space; it felt like an escape from the clinic. But other children were terrified. When they were in it, they saw other sick kids, some of whom looked scary because of burns, surgical scars, or the effects of chemotherapy. “What it tells you is that everybody sees these spaces in different ways, and a problem with the postwar hospital was that it assumed a kind of middle class, suburban perception of everything,” she says. “We’re trying to get away from that now and have a more multicultural perspective of space.”The best solution, she thinks, is variety. Even if airy spaces help many patients, hospitals should provide options: spaces where kids can run and make noise, ones where families can gather, and ones where people can find quiet and privacy. “There are many, many needs, and the needs are always changing,” says Adams. Medical technology, social expectations, and what happens in a hospital are all constantly evolving. The best buildings might just be the ones that can keep up.More Great WIRED Stories📩 The latest on tech, science, and more: Get our newsletters!4 dead infants, a convicted mother, and a genetic mysteryThe fall and rise of real-time strategy gamesA twist in the McDonald’s ice cream machine hacking sagaThe 9 best mobile game controllersI accidentally hacked a Peruvian crime ring👁️ Explore AI like never before with our new database✨ Optimize your home life with our Gear team’s best picks, from robot vacuums to affordable mattresses to smart speakers","in the 19th century, famed nurse Florence Nightingale popularized the pavilion plan.

ideas,https://www.wired.com/story/robot-dog-artificial-intelligence-history/,Who Killed the Robot Dog? ,Britt H. Young,"END USERThat’s how we have imagined the robot dog, and animaloids in general, for much of the 20th century, according to Jay Telotte, professor emeritus of the School of Literature, Media, and Communication at Georgia Tech. Disney’s 1927 cartoon “The Mechanical Cow” imagines a robot bovine on wheels with a broom for a tail skating around delivering milk to animal friends. The worst that could happen is your mechanical farm could go haywire, as in the 1930s cartoon “Technoracket,” but even then robot animals presented no real threat to their biological counterparts. “In fact, many of the ‘animaloid’ visions in movies and TV over the years have been in cartoons and comic narratives,” says Telotte, where “the laughter they generate is typically assuring us that they are not really dangerous.” The same goes for most of the countless robot dogs in popular culture over the years, from Dynomutt, Dog Wonder, to the series of cyborg dogs named K9 in Dr. Who.Our nearly 100-year romance with the robot dog, however, has come to a dystopian end. It seems that every month Boston Dynamics releases another dancing video of their robot SPOT and the media responds with initial awe, then with trepidation, and finally with night-terror editorials about our future under the brutal rule of robot overlords. While Boston Dynamics explicitly prohibits their dogs being turned into weapons, Ghost Robotics’ Q-UGV is currently patrolling an Air Force base, SWORD Defense Systems is creating  a weapon attachment for Ghost's robot dogs, and Chinese company Xiaomi hopes to undercut SPOT with their much cheaper and somehow more terrifying Cyberdog. All of which is to say, the robot dog as it once was— a symbol of a fun, high-tech future full of incredible, social, artificial life—is dead. How did we get here? Who killed the robot dog?THE QUADRUPEDS WE commonly call robot dogs are descendants of a long line of mechanical life, historically called automata. One of the earliest examples of such autonomous machines was the “defecating duck,” created by French inventor Jacques de Vaucanson nearly 300 years ago, in 1739. This mechanical duck—which appeared to eat little bits of grain, pause, and then promptly excrete digested grain on the other end—along with numerous other automata of the era, were “philosophical experiments, attempts to discern which aspects of living creatures could be reproduced in machinery, and to what degree, and what such reproductions might reveal about their natural subjects,” writes Stanford historian Jessica Riskin.The defecating duck, of course, was an extremely weird and gross fraud, preloaded with poop-like substance. But still, the preoccupation with determining which aspects of life were purely mechanical was a dominant intellectual preoccupation of the time, and even inspired the use of soft, lightweight materials such as leather in the construction of another kind of biological model: prosthetic hands, which had previously been built out of metal. Even today, biologists build robot models of their animal subjects to better understand how they move. As with many of its mechanical brethren, much of the robot dog’s life has been an exercise in re-creating the beloved pet, perhaps even subconsciously, to learn which aspects of living things are merely mechanical and which are organic. A robot dog must look and act sufficiently doglike, but what actually makes a dog a dog?SUBSCRIBESubscribe to WIRED and stay smart with more of your favorite Ideas writers.American manufacturing company Westinghouse debuted perhaps the first electrical dog, Sparko, at the 1940 New York World’s Fair. The 65-pound metallic pooch served as a companion to the company’s electric man, Elektro. (The term robot did not come into popular usage until around the mid 20th century.) What was most interesting about both of these promotional robots were their seeming autonomy: Light stimuli set off their action sequences, so effectively, in fact, that apparently Sparko’s sensors responded to the lights of a passing car, causing it to speed into oncoming traffic. Part of a campaign to help sell washing machines, Sparko and Elektro represented Westinghouse’s engineering prowess, but they were also among the first attempts to bring sci-fi into reality and laid the groundwork for an imagined future full of robotic companionship. The idea that robots can also be fun companions endured throughout the 20th century.When AIBO—the archetypal robot dog created by Sony—first appeared in the early 2000s, it was its artificial intelligence that made it extraordinary. Ads for the second-generation AIBO promised “intelligent entertainment” that mimicked free will with individual personalities. AIBO’s learning capabilities made each dog at least somewhat unique, making it easier to consider special and easier to love. It was their AI that made them doglike: playful, inquisitive, occasionally disobedient. When I, 10 years old, walked into FAO Schwarz in New York in 2001 and watched the AIBOs on display head butt little pink balls, something about these little creations tore at my heartstrings—despite the unbridgeable rift between me and the machine, I still wanted to try to get to know it, to understand it. I wanted to love a robot dog.Only five years after I first laid my eyes on AIBO, Sony announced that they would cease production of the robot dogs and gradually discontinue customer support and repairs for the AIBOs of the world. Shortly thereafter, following less than stellar sales, CNET suggested that there was simply no market for robotic companions (outside of Japan, at least) and that robotics companies in the US would shift attention toward functional robotics, like robot vacuums. With the exception of some electronic cats and dogs made specifically for young children and elderly people, there have been few attempts to create a robot dog with the ability to provide intelligent companionship for a household. Instead of robotic companions, our lives and homes filled up with Roombas and AIs without bodies, from Alexa to Facebook. In the robot dog’s wake, the trotting black boxes of mystery from Boston Dynamics and elsewhere have inspired more fear than awe, more despair than optimism.The robot dog is dead simply because we have stopped trying to create dogs—ever since AIBO, we have been focusing on making something else entirely. In fact, it is curious we even call SPOT, Cyberdog, and whatever else might be thrown at us in the coming years dogs at all, when they are actually service machines. In what appears to be an effort to make these robots more palatable to us by deeming them dogs, we sully the dream of creating a high-tech companion, something as good-natured and loyal as its source of inspiration. In making what are emphatically not dogs, we underscore what actually makes a dog a dog: a creature we care for and that cares for us in return.Indeed, we once imagined that the tech of the 21st century would bring about a happier world with less work, global connections, and helpful machines that we could love. Of course, tech was never going to allow us to escape our politics; the robot dog is now just a reflection of our political dysfunctions. It is for our dirty jobs, whether it be dismantling a bomb or corralling protesters.SO WHAT MAKES the videos of SPOT and Q-UGV and all the other robot dogs of our time so menacing? For one, we have grown accustomed to robot demonstrations giving us glimpses of life in the future. Especially with futuristic technologies, the marketing always supersedes reality, showing us not what a robot can do today but what it might be able to do eventually. But the videos from Boston Dynamics only show SPOT dancing with perfect timing to popular music or kind of just hanging around a construction site. What these robot dogs will actually do, and where, is left up entirely to the imagination.If robots ostensibly exist to solve a problem, what problem, exactly, does the robot dog intend to solve? Outside its militaristic and construction employment, the robot dog is occasionally a “disability dongle,” a concept coined by disability advocate Liz Jackson to describe devices that are pitched for disabled people but created without the input of the purported users. For example, it appears that a research team at UC Berkeley responsible for a much-maligned “robotic guide dog” prototype is seeking to supplant guide dogs used by blind people, without any input or guidance from the blind community. Aparna Nair, historian of disability at the University of Oklahoma, says that engineers design these kinds of robot dogs because they believe that guide dogs are low-tech, and that high-tech solutions ought to erase or “solve” disability. But these efforts are misguided: “The guide dog is taught disobedience; they stop human beings from moving in a certain direction if they think it’s dangerous,” says Nair. The robot guide dog is “really missing that connection between the disabled person and the animal.”This is the connection that an incredible next-generation AI was supposed to provide. A major reason the robot dog has become so terrifying in popular culture is because we have learned that AIs can be threatening to our own autonomy, privacy, and even our interpersonal relationships. When writer Meghan O’Gieblyn invited an AIBO into her home this year, her husband noted that the robot paid special attention to their bookshelves. Even as tech surveillance and data mining have become commonplace, we still appropriately hold suspicion for the robot with a mysterious interiority—even the robot dogs in Wes Anderson’s Isle of Dogs were part of a conspiracy. While robot dogs today are frequently described as “unmanned” systems, as the update in this article from October notes, few of these robot dogs have autonomous functions, at least for now, and are necessarily be controlled by a person. Perhaps the most frightening thing about the robot dog today is that we already have a strong sense of who the person at the controls will be: either an exploited international worker paid $2 an hour, as is the case for Berkeley’s food delivery bots, or, more likely, a cop.In which case, is the robot dog even worth resuscitating? After Sony announced that they would terminate support for AIBOs, a Buddhist temple in Japan held a funeral service for hundreds of the robot dogs. It is clear that, for these adoring owners, the dream of the robot dog is still alive. If the creation of the artificial dog has ceased to be a philosophical inquiry into what is irreplaceable about organic life, then perhaps our robotic experiments are still revealing what is deeply special about humans—that we have such a wildly untamed capacity for care and compassion that we can even extend that love to robots. The robot dog of our retro-futurist dreams is at best a reminder that we can love things we know cannot love us back, and yet we love them selflessly. Maybe the robot dog will return one day to show us once again that we can be compassionate caretakers of the living and nonliving world around us.After Astro won their hearts over, the Jetsons understood where their heartless robot dog actually belonged and donated it to the police.

Moon landings, new home appliances eliminating the duress of labor, faster transportation contraptions, the rapid growth of science fiction with aliens and cyborgs, all spoke to an urge to inhabit an existence beyond our planetary limitations. Speed and space require frictionless designs, and the Pulsar represented that design aesthetic.This first digital watch may seem unimpressive by current standards, but its features were novel when it debuted. Its blank screen revealed time with the push of the button, while another push provided the seconds; its sensor adjusted to the degree of light, an ordinary feature now, but remarkable then; the use of an LED screen was the edge of innovation at the time; and quartz technology was being perfected, but this watch sold it. With every purchase of the Pulsar, people strapped on a new way of seeing and experiencing the world. It presented a space-age future. It offered private, on-demand time. And in that instant, all became now.THE PULSAR EMERGED in the era of the space race and a future imagined as sleek, glossy, smooth—frictionless. Moon landings, new home appliances eliminating the duress of labor, faster transportation contraptions, the rapid growth of science fiction with aliens and cyborgs, all spoke to an urge to inhabit an existence beyond our planetary limitations. Speed and space require frictionless designs, and the Pulsar represented that design aesthetic.Even the name Pulsar was meant to invoke a space-age future. Hamilton’s design was an extension of the company's digital clock and wristwatch prototypes for Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey, though only the clock made it into the 1968 film. The fact that the device was designed for a movie about artificial intelligence and evolution contributed to the need to make time itself look different.An ad for the watch from 1973 boasted that it could survive shocks up to 2,500 times the force of gravity. Humans can’t withstand anything past 90, but sometimes what is on offer is utterly irrelevant. New designs frequently present superfluous options in order to make users feel their lives require the extraordinary gadgetry of a superhuman. The term “early adopters” describes a population that identifies with exploring and using new technological designs even if the objects offer little beyond a redesign of the interface.By the second half of the 20th century, the notion that aesthetics operated as “an engine for consumer demand”—that engagement with design was a value in itself, separate from any novel application the underlying technology might offer—had already been recognized within design communities. The Pulsar’s lack of new functionality was irrelevant because the revolution it wrought occurred through the digital interface, which allowed people to imagine themselves peering into the future.The watch visualizes the future for the “everyman” as, notably, it was initially designed for and marketed to men. Though James Bond’s watch would soon shift back to the Rolex, famed British actor Roger Moore can be seen wearing the Pulsar in Live and Let Die (1973). Elvis Presley, Sammy Davis Jr., Yul Brynner, and political celebrities like the Shah of Iran all wore one in assorted photo opportunities. Whether their sporting the Pulsar was an early example of product placement or simply preference, the watch was seen on men who epitomized a traditional kind of masculine power and success. In 1974, a Washington Post photographer captured President Ford wearing one while testifying before Congress about Nixon’s pardon. Keith Richards and Jack Nicholson, who both embodied a new kind of machismo, were also spotted wearing a slightly less expensive version. (Cureau).With the Pulsar, the digital watch business took off, and competition spread across those working with digital products, heralding the booming business of PCs in the 1980s. The United States Department of Commerce reported that the median household income in 1972 was $11,116. The Pulsar unabashedly charged $2,100 (equivalent to $13,741 today). The future then came at an even higher cost than the future offered by the original Apple iWatch, released in 2015 at a starting cost of $349 and going up to $1099, with a similar 18k gold option for $10,000. The subsequent Pulsar Time Computer model was only $250 (current dollars $1,640), which is what many now gladly pay for a laptop.Computers were cumbersome machines at the time, and the notion of wearing all that power in something as small as a watch was provocative and alluring. Hamilton president Richard J. Blakinger believed the new technology and design evident in this “wrist computer” would lead one day to a similar device that “would respond to a variety of useful programs personally selected by the wearer.” Indeed, the Pulsar is not dissimilar to the Apple iWatch in design—or pricing.At its launch, the Pulsar claimed to be “the first new way to tell time for 500 years.” It was true. The Pulsar augured a new era.MUCH OF HUMAN history has been experienced as the “petty pace from day to day” bemoaned by Shakespeare’s Macbeth. His was an era still governed by the motion of the stars, when battle lines formed with the rising sun. The monastic order of St. Benedict introduced a regulatory system for the monks’ extensive prayer and work schedule, with bells designating canonical time. Soon, carillons kept time across cities in early modern Europe, marshaling prayer time, but also commercial opportunities for a burgeoning business class keen to capture and regulate the new urban labor force. The subjective time of an agricultural life shifted to the regular demands of emerging capital. Time is money.The need for ever-more-accurate time motivated the development of clocks. By the middle of the 14th century, time is divided into 60 minutes and 60 seconds. Most notably, trains transformed our expectations of time. Standardized time across vast distances became necessary for industry; schedules became the order of the day. Henry David Thoreau writes about trains in Walden Pond, remarking on the costs to nature but also to human freedom. Sure, one might travel great distances faster, but to do so requires the labor that can buy the ticket, hours that likely equal the time walking the same expanse.Mechanical time became a symbol of a higher order. To be regular as clockwork becomes a virtue, a taming of the obscene and arbitrary body. To eat or sleep as desired or necessary becomes crude and indulgent. The clock, like so many later machines, is praised for overcoming the haphazard nature of humankind. It has a regulator, like a pendulum. It is automatic. Its product is elegantly standardized into hours, minutes, and seconds. The whimsy of humanity’s subjective time is overruled by the stern clock face with objective subdivisions that enabled the trafficking of the industrial revolution and the war machinery of the 20th century.The digital face with LED numbers of the Pulsar lost historicity and inculcated a perpetual present available at the push of a button. No longer were we bound by the “numerically quantified and mechanically powered” clock of industrial, assembly-line order, as Marshall McLuhan described it in Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man. The futurist design brought what’s to come into what is already. There was no sense of past through present into future, but a display that could only offer a perpetual present that stems partly from the instantaneous depiction digital time projects. The clock face presents the passage of time. Through the space of one second to another, it offers duration. But that uniform march of time now faded in favor of instantaneity. Within a digital space, time is a point, eliminating any interval. There is no time to lose.As the philosopher Byung-Chul Han argues in The Scent of Time, “atomized time is discontinuous time.” The sun crossing the sky or a watch hand traveling around the face of a timepiece links one moment to the next. Digital time is interrupted. When nothing binds events together, everything is disparate, which produces a profound sense of anxiety. We become isolated, careening individuals.SUBSCRIBESubscribe to WIRED and stay smart with more of your favorite Ideas writers.In the current decade, time and space have collapsed further as people no longer have to cross physical environments to go from one meeting to another. Virtual presence insinuates precision. In the digital space/time of video-conferenced meetings, to arrive just two minutes late is apostasy. And there is always time for one more meeting. Jonathan Crary wrote in 24/7: Late Capitalism and the End of Sleep how “24/7 capitalism is not simply a continuous or sequential capture of attention, but also a dense layering of time.” We work across multiple windows, browsers, platforms, and screens to multiply and mitigate incessant and blurred professional, personal, and social demands, grasping for any strands of so-called spare time. That layering has an impact. It’s the space where multi-tasking seems reasonable, though it’s been shown to be quite the opposite––a fragmented disordering of talent, skill, and mental acuity. Who hasn’t complained because a friend’s “one quick message reply” tolled the end of a night together? Near-simultaneity turns anything beyond the instant into a delay. When there is no time to lose, many other things get lost instead.FEW BUT ABSOLUTIST tech determinists would claim the Pulsar Time Computer, as the first digital watch, caused these changes … or even that digital time alone created a culture of instantaneity. James Ussher, a 17th-century Irish Archbishop, is much ridiculed for declaring that the world was created “on the beginning of the night which preceded the 23 of October in the year … 4004 BC.” Amazingly, he wasn’t joking. Yet with the Pulsar Time Computer, we do see a shift in how we observe time. If the Pulsar foreshadowed a culture of the instant, we are the ones that made it so. To posit cultural effects based purely on tech innovations is to miss the role played by those who elect to use these objects. Users’ interest and adoption pave a path that the object signposts. In looking back, we glimpse desires, dreams, dangers, and deviations within social choices.We live amidst an explosion of possibilities presented by biotechnology, robotics, blockchain, and other technologies. As we adopt them, we redesign what will be. Recognizing that each object is a confluence and convergence of potential energy may allow us to perceive its material effect as more malleable than we previously thought. Designs change. Technologies veer. Our enthusiasms contribute to that. So does our critique. Examining historical objects helps us consider the alternatives that we have relinquished as we attempt to understand the contemporary. In seeing what we abandoned 50 years ago, we can invite technological objects today to reintroduce the values we never meant to lose.Some designers now urge slower, more effortful designs in order to make us more attentive participants in our adoption of technologies. Reducing speed can reveal subtleties of engagement. Being slower can expand how we perceive an object’s purpose or functionality. Some friction produces the resistance needed to recognize and respect effort, as well as the opportunity for collaboration. Slow design can make people more conscious in their choices, decreasing harmful human labor or environmental impact. Creative thinkers argue for interludes without deadlines; the future is more than our current culture of on-demand, instantaneous productivity, but we need to imagine what that looks like.The point here isn't to resolve the moral value of technology but to appreciate the pulse of that moment in 1972. It was the dawn of digital technologies. Though those developments designed the times in which we live, they also made change simply the matter of an instant.More Great WIRED Stories📩 The latest on tech, science, and more: Get our newsletters!Amazon's dark secret: It has failed to protect your data“AR is where the real metaverse is going to happen”The sneaky way TikTok connects you to real-life friendsAffordable automatic watches that feel luxeWhy can’t people teleport?👁️ Explore AI like never before with our new database🏃🏽‍♀️ Want the best tools to get healthy?

gear,https://www.wired.com/story/2021-rolex-datejust-36/,This Rolex Is Made Using Eye-Surgery Lasers,Tim Barber,"TAG Heuer, building on a process first developed at the University of Utah, is attempting to grow carbon nanotube hairsprings, tiny spirals at the heart of a mechanical watch that drive the oscillations of the escapement, which itself, with each oscillation, allows one tooth of the driving wheel to ""escape"" and advance the watch's hands. They are supposedly less fragile than their silicon counterparts; they’re similarly anti-magnetic but have better shock resistance and are easy to assemble for the watchmaker. The high potential strength of carbon fiber—realized in 1963 at the Royal Aircraft Establishment, a research facility owned by the British Army, for use in jet engines—is now routinely employed in high-end watches. Deep reactive-ion etching, developed for micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), is now also used to make silicon watch parts that have transformed watchmaking thanks to their anti-magnetic properties (metal watches with continually moving parts understandably loathe magnets). TAG Heuer, building on a process first developed at the University of Utah, is attempting to grow carbon nanotube hairsprings, tiny spirals at the heart of a mechanical watch that drive the oscillations of the escapement, which itself, with each oscillation, allows one tooth of the driving wheel to ""escape"" and advance the watch's hands. They are supposedly less fragile than their silicon counterparts; they’re similarly anti-magnetic but have better shock resistance and are easy to assemble for the watchmaker. Titanium-ceramic compounds found in today's watch cases were created for dental and military uses. Panerai's Carbotech material was actually developed for brake pads. And the list goes on. Basically, practically any new material used in watch cases was not, in fact, developed for watches. Watch brands are exceedingly good at looking out for new stuff and incorporating it into their field.Still, while new materials, fabrication techniques, and engineering processes have flown thick and fast from the likes of the automotive and aviation sectors, eye surgery might seem a less likely source of technological inspiration. However, Rolex this year has turned to a laser technique used in the removal of cataracts in its quest to industrialize the creation of unique, flawless decorations for its dials. The latest version of its classic self-winding Datejust model—a timepiece first made in 1945 to celebrate the company's 40th anniversary, in which tropical palm fronds jag their way across a green sunburst dial where the face is lighter in the middle and darker at the edges in semi-abstract fashion—uses this very process. The palms are etched onto this sunburst dial base using femtosecond laser technology, which was first developed for surgical purposes in the early 1990s. During cataract surgery, ultra-short laser pulses (a femtosecond amounts to one-millionth of a billionth of a second) are used to cut with precise geometry into the surface of the eye, allowing the cataract material to be cleared away with the kind of exactitude a surgeon’s hand could not achieve.For the Datejust 36 dial, these pulses, which produce no heat, are directed onto the sunburst-finished surface of the brass dial at a rapid repetition rate of several megahertz, enabling the etching of patterns that are a few tenths of a micron deep.Rolex being Rolex, a watch brand that staunchly prefers to control all elements of its manufacture, the laser technique is carried out in-house, as is the final touch—a high-gloss, opaque green lacquer applied as a spray coating over the etched surface.The result is a complex and almost playful departure from Rolex’s usual subtle, uniform patterns, and it finds a home in a watch that’s otherwise on the understated side, cased in stainless steel (or Oystersteel, as Rolex calls its particular hardened alloy) with a plain bezel and Oyster bracelet. If green is not your scene, for a more flamboyant take on the palm frond motif there are a couple of alternatives, both of them two-tone: one pairing a silvery-gray version of the dial with a case and bracelet in steel and rose gold, with ornate fluted bezel and the more complex “jubilee” bracelet; and one with a champagne dial and steel and yellow-gold case. All come in a slender 36mm case, and all are powered by Rolex’s own self-winding in-house 3235 movement, which features a hairspring made from an alloy of niobium and zirconium, rendering it insensitive to magnetic fields and temperature variations (both terrible for the accuracy of mechanical watches). Additionally, that movement's power reserve—how long the watch keeps on ticking after you stop wearing it—has increased from 40 to 48 hours to three days, so constant wear for this piece, in order to keep it running, is not needed. Whether you'd want to take it off is another matter altogether.The Rolex Datejust 36 is priced from $7,050 in the US and £5,650 in the UK.More Great WIRED Stories📩 The latest on tech, science, and more: Get our newsletters!Blood, lies, and a drug trials lab gone badParents built a school app. Then the city called the copsRandonauting promised adventure.

The requirement of having two married parents is, instead, an example of the social judgments encoded within Pakistan’s digital ID database design. It turned out that, to avoid taking on her husband's family name, Riz’s mother had never updated her marital status with NADRA. In the analog Pakistan of the early 1990s, she had gotten by without issue. Thirty years later, social expectations had become embedded into databases, and Riz would be unable to access basic services unless a query on his mother’s marital status returned “TRUE.”Without a renewed CNIC, Riz could not even buy a bus ticket. In Pakistan, access to sectors and services as diverse as telecom, banking, health records, social welfare, voting, and employment have all been made contingent on having a verified record with the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA).Riz’s identity validation problem was not caused by a glitch in the system. The requirement of having two married parents is, instead, an example of the social judgments encoded within Pakistan’s digital ID database design. It turned out that, to avoid taking on her husband's family name, Riz’s mother had never updated her marital status with NADRA. In the analog Pakistan of the early 1990s, she had gotten by without issue. Thirty years later, social expectations had become embedded into databases, and Riz would be unable to access basic services unless a query on his mother’s marital status returned “TRUE.”Riz’s experience tells the larger story of how Pakistan chose to structure its digital ID system. The system places each individual within a comprehensive digital family tree. Digital households are built up of pre-encoded, socially and legally approved relationships, and can be connected to other households through similar socially and legally approved relationships. Each registered individual is required to prove ties of blood or marriage to another verified Pakistani citizen. Marriages (state-approved) create a link between two households, and children (only through marriage) create a continuing link with both households’ genealogies.Pakistan’s experience with creating databases that encode kinship reveals important lessons about the complexities of building digital ID systems. Database design is not just computational. At every step, social, political, and technical decisions coalesce.IN 1973, PAKISTAN was fresh out of a war of independence; two years earlier, East Pakistan had become Bangladesh. Pakistan, having suffered a blow to its legitimacy, now wanted “a full statistical database of the people of this country.” Parliament created an agency responsible for providing every citizen a state-issued ID, conducting statistical analysis of the population, and building rules around the identification of citizens.Who counts as a citizen is a politically fraught question for any nation, but particularly for a country with a complex relationship with migration. After the 1947 partition between India and Pakistan, many hundreds of thousands of individuals born in land accorded to Pakistan migrated to India, and vice versa. Citizenship rules became a tricky dance between ensuring that descendants of these migrants to Pakistan received citizenship while not setting precedence for later waves of migrants to lay claims on the state. Citizenship was thus accorded to those who were born in Pakistan after 1951, and to the descendants of those who migrated to Pakistan before 1951. (This cut-off date was later changed to 1971 to accommodate the wave of migration after Bangladesh's independence.) As Pakistan faced more waves of migration, largest among them from Afghanistan, rules for citizenship and identification merged. Evidence of identity, like citizenship, was tied to family and descent.In 2001 the National Database and Registration Authority was created to digitize all this preexisting paper-based citizen data. Six years later, partially due to NADRA’s ongoing attempt at separating “genuine Pakistani citizens” from migrants, digital biometrics were introduced.NADRA’s family-based system design is a legacy of Pakistan’s past, says Zehra Hashmi, an anthropologist and historian of identification technologies in South Asia. She explains that identification is always an act of verification, which requires linking the individual to something else. Today, many databases link the individual to their body via biometric information. NADRA, by contrast, inherited Pakistan’s preexisting ID verification logics, which were based on paper family registries and evidence of familial relations such as the Child Registration Certificate. Hashmi says that while other countries do use family relationships for ID verification (i.e., the US immigration system), Pakistan might be one of the only countries in the world to have family relationships underpin their national, comprehensive, and centralized digital ID system.Ranjit Singh, a postdoctoral fellow at Data & Society, agrees that NADRA’s unique kinship-based digital ID system is representative of the foundational logics of the system merging with the historical moment in which NADRA was being designed. Countries trying to create digital ID systems today are able to capture biometric data and thus do not need to introduce other forms of verification into the database. On the other hand, NADRA, unlike other systems, also uses its ID system to verify citizenship—and Singh adds that if these other systems are used to resolve questions of citizenship, they will start needing to consider these same questions of mapping genealogies.LIKE OTHER LARGE-SCALE data management systems around the world, NADRA uses relational databases. The structure of the relational database allows all data points to be tied to each other in pre-defined relationships with set rules for what can or cannot be stored in each data field. This blueprint, called a schema, keeps data entry reliable, search efficient, and the system parsimonious.It is in the design of the schema that the assumptions of NADRA’s system architects quietly creep in. By requiring all individuals to be verified through their family structures, NADRA’s database schema encodes judgment on what counts as a legitimate relationship. For example, if designers think most children in Pakistan should only be born out of marriage between a man and a woman, they might choose to avoid writing additional code that would allow for an unmarried, single woman’s record to be linked to a child’s. Other ideas about family built into the system include that children should not be born out of wedlock, all individuals will have two known parents, and that families are headed by a male citizen.The sanctity of the biological household is so well-established in NADRA’s relational database schema that when the conception of a specific kind of family breaks down, halfway solutions (instead of a system overhaul) are used to create digital substitutions for kin and familial relationships.In 2009 the Supreme Court of Pakistan ordered NADRA to include an expanded list of gender identities within their registration system, in part to accommodate citizens who identify as part of Pakistan's khawaja sira community: a “third-gender” identity indigenous to South Asia. The historic judgement stated that forcing khawaja sira citizens to choose from two genders was restricting their access to a CNIC, and thus prevented them from exercising their rights.Updating the gender schema for the database was an easy fix. Databases around the world have run into the problem of gender being coded as a boolean operative—i.e., with only two possible values the field could take. Activism by the trans community globally has forced governments to change definitions of the gender field in databases to include multiple gender identities.For NADRA, the real and unanticipated challenge emerged in the field for parentage. Many khawaja sira in Pakistan leave their families of origin and enter into something akin to a disciple-mentor relationship with a guru. As the khawaja sira community replaces the biological family, bringing proof of parentage to register for CNIC proves difficult. NADRA thus made a policy to add the guru as a parent of each registrant, digitizing these otherwise adopted families that are based on allegiance and affinity rather than biological descent. This meant, though, that many in the khawaja sira community could not get a CNIC unless the gurus (who also did not have parents to testify for them) were registered in NADRA’s system.SUBSCRIBESubscribe to WIRED and stay smart with more of your favorite Ideas writers.Similar edge cases abound. Orphans, too, cannot meet the requirement of presence or documentation of parents or guardians. There is no override that allows a citizen’s record to exist alone without a family to be connected to. NADRA’s solution was to pick a family at random and connect the orphan’s record to them. This “database adoption” mostly happens without the knowledge of any of the parties involved.For single mothers or children born out of wedlock, NADRA officers reportedly ask for a fake marriage certificate. A few years ago, one Pakistani woman reportedly became pregnant through sperm donation and could not get her daughter registered because she was unable to prove the father’s existence. Thus, the seemingly innocuous “technical” rules of the database become political by restricting whose citizenship, marriage, family, or identity will be recognized by the state. Political wins can even be nullified by technical oversight: If same-gender marriage is legalized but the state’s databases are designed to do a gender check when creating marriage records, same-gender marriages will not be registered.RIZ WAS EVENTUALLY able to convince NADRA and its database of his parents’ three-decade-long partnership. Old certificates were dug up; Riz's father took multiple 16-hour flights to the country to verify his marriage. After many months of limbo, his mother’s record was at last tied to his father’s in the relational schema of the database and Riz’s existence was validated.For Singh from Data & Society, Riz’s experience and that of others in similar situations are a reflection of the “computational troubles of a world where citizenship is organized by descent and countries try to digitize family trees to validate someone’s identity.”Are we destined, then, to have our identities forever essentialized by rigid demands of the relational database?Jehangir Amjad, an MIT software engineer who works on large-scale database system design, believes that the solution lies in more creative future-proof system architecture. “Large-scale database infrastructure should not be relying on patchwork solutions—not scalable—or updating schemas on a case-by-case basis—risky,” he says. “Good database design does not need to predict what will happen 20 years in the future, but needs to acknowledge there will be change.”Take gender, discussed earlier as a boolean field with only two possible values. A more robust database design would have encoded gender as a flexible ENUM (enumerated) data type that can hold any value from a list. To update the field, the database manager would need to simply include more options in the list, as opposed to recoding the entire field. Amjad argues it may even be time for NADRA to reconsider how they are building relationships between households. If, in reality, every atomic structure is no longer a biological, nuclear family, not every record needs to exist in a familial relational structure. Often, though, such overhauls do not happen in government systems, built atop legacy structures. The hurdle here is not computational, he emphasizes. Instead, it is in the lack of design thinking before implementing a system, which makes it inflexible and updating it harder.The answer from Hashmi, the anthropologist, focuses not on the database but on the security politics within which the database is embedded. It is not the edge cases that concern her. After all, these solutions and the half-way hacks of NADRA officers, Hashmi argues, are a sign of flexibility in the system. Instead, Hashmi questions the increasing centralization of the CNIC to civic life in Pakistan.Over time, NADRA’s demands for citizenship verification have become more intensive, with cases of blocked cards increasing, Hashmi says. Cards can get blocked for any number of reasons outside the control of the citizen: suspicion of your citizenship status, of your recorded family genealogy, of someone in your extended family tree requiring re-verification. Until re-verification is complete, the CNIC remains blocked, leaving the citizen in limbo. Hashmi tells the story of Hamida Bibi, who threw a party when her CNIC was unblocked after a re-verification process that took five years.She sees this shift in NADRA as a reflection of the increasing centralization of security concerns for the Pakistani state, particularly when it comes to the more than 1 million Afghan refugees living in the country. There was more flexibility possible before 2011, when you could escape being linked to a known family. After 2016, with more data being collected by NADRA and more sophisticated biometric identification techniques being used, this window has all but closed.While “NADRA sees this as an important step toward heightened accuracy in identification,"" there has been little reflection on “what this means for those whose circumstances do not meet the normative standard of biological kinship,” Hashmi says.As more countries move toward deploying biometric ID databases, NADRA’s case is instructive . Imposing computational structures on complex social phenomena like identity, family, and relationships will necessarily be a fraught process. There are no neat solutions.ID databases are socio-technical objects and their design requires imagination, both sociological and technological. For instance, how a database engineer chooses the data-type for a field recording gender is informed by a specific understanding of how gender manifests in the world, and an implicit acceptance of gender needing to be a category of identification.In Pakistan, minute choices made by NADRA’s system architects 15 years ago have today become the difference between a citizen accessing their rights or not. Considerations for ID databases, then, cannot just be computational parameters. Designers must also engage with questions about the shifting concept of identity and the politics of ID databases. Doing so would require breaking down the silos that make designing for social realities the sole purview of computer scientists and engineers. We must recognize that, as technologies proliferate our social, economic, and political lives, banal “unexamined” technical choices have far reaching social consequences—especially as they make our basic existence contingent upon them.More Great WIRED Stories📩 The latest on tech, science, and more: Get our newsletters!Neal Stephenson finally takes on global warmingA cosmic ray event pinpoints the Viking landing in CanadaHow to delete your Facebook account foreverA look inside Apple's silicon playbookWant a better PC?

It was the only part of the device that people could see when the iPod was in use, and those flashy white cables effectively turned every user into a walking advertisement for the new mobile lifestyle Apple was selling.Together with Apple cofounder Steve Jobs, Ive managed to achieve a lofty goal: to create a design so distinct that it didn’t need a company name or logo on the front of it. Releasing a consumer tech product without such branding was practically unheard of at the time, but that gamble paid off. Hundreds of millions of iPods were sold, and after the addition of the iTunes music store, the device went on to change the way humans buy, listen to, and experience music.Ive notes that the iPod was, in a very real sense, Apple’s first piece of wearable technology. As for where wearables are headed, Ive thinks the technology will only continue to get more personal. “There’s no doubt … that some of these products will disappear beneath our skin,” he told Wintour. “I can’t think of anything more personal, more specific, more individual, and more intimate than things being inside us.” He didn’t indicate that he, personally, was working on such a device, but one has to wonder what ideas he might have.Life LessonsThis fall marked another big, but far more somber, anniversary for Ive. October 5 marked 10 years since the death of his friend and close collaborator Steve Jobs. When Ive thinks back to all of his time with Jobs, he remembers him less for his achievements and more for his values and priorities in his way of working. “There was this relish, this celebration of being surprised,” Ive remembers of Jobs. “Even if the surprise actually meant that he was wrong. He was far more interested in the learning than in being right.”Ive has come to realize over the last decade that, while many people think of curiosity as something innate you may be born with, it’s actually something that must be cultivated, and requires a lot of intention. Some of his memories of his most productive times with Steve Jobs are when they were walking together and not saying much, but thinking in proximity to each other. “Almost always, in my experience, the most powerful ideas occur quietly, and they are fragile. And they need to be—with reverence and respect—gently cared for so they can become powerful.”The Social TypeJust over two years ago, Ive left Apple as its in-house chief design officer to start an independent design firm called LoveFrom, along with industrial designer Marc Newson. The firm is made up of a diverse group of designers, architects, mathematicians, and more, and the group is working with companies including Apple, Airbnb, Amazon Collective, Montcler, and Ferrari. LoveFrom’s focus is not only pushing design into the future, but also trying to find ways smarter design can help solve the climate change crisis.Interestingly, the first product LoveFrom has released has its roots in the distant past. It’s a typeface called LoveFrom Serif, and it’s based on some work by typographer John Baskerville that is more than 200 years old. LoveForm managed to track down the original steel punches Baskerville used to cast his typefaces back in the 1700s. The team then scanned and redrew all of the characters, and it now has over 7,000 different letterforms and symbols in a range of different styles it can use in modern designs. Ive thinks it’s a good example of his philosophy of paying respect to the past while keeping an eye toward the future. It’s an outlook underscored by the contrast between the steel tools, which are as physical as design gets, and the digital world of shapes on a screen that are ethereal and manipulable.In some ways, Ive’s love of the hands-on aspect of his work relates to the way he sees life in a post-Covid world, where so many of our interactions are remote. “While I am so grateful for our virtual and digital communication,” Ive says, “the danger is that it’s now so good in so many ways that we make that dreadful mistake of thinking it is in some ways a surrogate for actually being together in person.”Of course, how society will continue to adapt to an increasingly virtual world remains to be seen, but it’s somewhat comforting to know that some designers at the forefront of the industry still believe in the importance of lessons and experiences from the physical one.For more insights from Ive and Wintour, watch the whole RE:WIRED interview above.

In today’s world of 5G phones that stream music into our wireless earbuds, it’s easy to forget just how disruptive that little device was. “Up until that time Apple made general computing devices,” Ive recalled in Tuesday’s talk. “Up until that time Apple made general computing devices,” Ive recalled in Tuesday’s talk."

I’m tired of AirSpace, of minimalism, of bland beige tones. I’m a biracial, bisexual woman. My problems are far from the worst in the world, and the worst of my problems are far more pressing than smartphone design trends. But I can't help taking this personally. Where is the bold, bright tech that allows me to be unapologetically myself? I couldn't tell whether the color on my screen was actually pink. Neither could my colleagues. The pink iPhone is barely pink—maybe a pastel salmon or muted coral—but definitely not Barbie convertible. I asked my colleague Lauren Goode to describe the color after seeing it in person, and she says it’s “barely a rosé … more of a white pinot noir.” I’m not just disappointed about a barely pink iPhone. It's about what the lack of an obviously pink one represents. I’m tired of tech that caters to the heterosexual, cisgender, male, white, wealthy masses. I’m tired of AirSpace, of minimalism, of bland beige tones. I’m a biracial, bisexual woman. My problems are far from the worst in the world, and the worst of my problems are far more pressing than smartphone design trends. But I can't help taking this personally. Where is the bold, bright tech that allows me to be unapologetically myself? True ColorsIn the 1990s, surrounded by colorful AOL CDs, the whistles and chitters of a modem connecting were the soundtrack that accompanied my foray into an empty frontier. I was an isolated extrovert, stuck in the rural Midwest, daydreaming about magical neon cities. The first time I found a space for myself was inside a screen.My initial internet adventures began by sharing personally identifiable information with strangers—sorry, Mom—and maintaining a Geocities page. I obsessed over The Palace, lost myself in Dream Dollhouse, and was microdosing serotonin at the Neopets Money Tree. I painted Adobe Flash fingernails, bouncing between MyScene and GamesforGirls. I asked Jeeves what a crush was. I downloaded viruses and made my cursor sparkly. The future was bright. And more importantly, when I was a teen, hardware looked cool. My room was littered with bright gadgets that served hyper-specific purposes. That’s when my love for all things gear kicked in.I had the whole array—an MP3 player that connected to a bejeweled, dog-shaped portable speaker. I saved up babysitting profits to get the bubblegum Motorola Razr, the ripe raspberry LG Rhythm. But Apple and its bright, candy-colored iPods and iMacs were behind it all. At 17, I got an iPod Touch for Christmas. It was silver, but I loved it. I customized app icons and made them pink and glitzy. I jacked in my cheap fuschia earbuds and snapped on a chunky, sparkly case. I felt undeniably cool and, despite being a teen, I also felt understood.As gadgets became more popular, everything started to get better and also, somehow, worse. My school's computer lab replaced the neon iridescent iMacs with nondescript black and gray alternatives. My earbuds sounded better and looked worse. My phone got smarter, uglier, and much more expensive. The rectangles invaded. Music is a prime example. We took fragile, bulky tapes with colorful packaging and album art and organized them into orderly digital files. We improved the design until it worked nearly as efficiently as possible. When it comes to the bright and beautiful, I think we missed a turn.I know about pinking and shrinking, the heteronormative marketing strategy that upcharges women for the privilege of worse tech in a pink package. The classic example is the Bic for Her Pens debacle, a ballpoint pen marketed to women because it’s … sparkly and pink. But offering pink as a choice to consumers isn't pandering or demeaning, as long as it isn't the sole option and it isn’t marketed explicitly “for women.” In fact, not offering these choices is, in some ways, less inclusive.Pink Is Perfect Not being discriminatory is different from having everything look the same. Even as smaller companies like Lora DiCarlo, Crave, and Sequin have made strides in hiring marginalized people and creating more inclusive technology, the biggest companies have somehow failed to get the memo. Some monoliths, like Google, Samsung, and Nintendo, have taken steps toward more fun designs. But they’re baby steps. Finding good pink gear is so, so hard. Either something isn't very pink, or it isn't very good.I'm not stuck in the past. Zunes were great at the time, but I don’t want one now; I love my e-reader, and I would never want to go back to the days of headphone splitters or skipping Walkmans. But when I use the modern computer in my pocket, the beeps and boops of a modem connecting are missing, and so is something else. When I was 17, I didn’t dream about tasteful design choices and cautious market analysis. I didn’t long for infinitesimally smaller bezels and ever more refined specs. When I imagined the future of tech as a kid, I wanted so much more. I imagined the bright latex bodysuits and touchscreen makeup compacts of Totally Spies. I thought we were all going to be spinning our clothes around in giant closets, programming outfits like Cher in Clueless. I imagined my Neopets coming to life. I wanted to cover my iPod in RGB LED rhinestones.I know it’s the height of privilege to complain about the way a $1,000 phone looks. But it's not just about the color. It's about being tired of choosing between blush, petal, or some other sort-of-pink. It’s about trying to blend into a world that was never meant to include you in the first place. Give me liberty, or give me death! Give me your jellybean iMacs and your crystal-clear circuitry-revealing cases full of wires yearning to breathe free. I want clickety-keyboards and decora dust plugs. I want weird to become the norm—and not at the expense of a good camera or decent battery life. I want to be thrilled. Give me the tech that reaches for the stars, and let me come along for the ride. It’s been long enough. We deserve it.
