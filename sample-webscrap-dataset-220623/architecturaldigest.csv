That’s the term that Aerin Lauder, the designer, uses to describe her new getaway in Palm Beach, which she just moved into a couple of months ago. It’s also the word that the AD100 interior designer Stephen Sills, a longtime friend who handled the decors in collaboration with Lauder, uses to describe the project in general. “It’s an intelligent house,” he explains. “A pretty house with a beautiful layout, a romantic history, and lovely gardens, like an enchanting French pavilion.”Lauder, whose parents live across the street—“close, but not too close,” she jokes—had been captivated by the place since she was a child, ultimately dreaming of the life that she and her husband, financier Eric Zinterhofer, could create there. Until then, though, the couple raised their two sons, Will and Jack, in Manhattan, spending time, among other residences, at her family’s Palm Beach mansion, which had belonged to her cosmetics-queen grandmother Estée Lauder.Firework contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.But a couple of years ago, Lauder’s dream house, designed in 1930 by architect Howard Major in the Louis XVI style and faced with picturesquely pitted Cuban limestone, came on the market, and she snapped it up. “I’ve never had my own home in Palm Beach,” she says.In the living room, bespoke sofas and painted Louis XVI chairs are grouped around white lacquered Parsons-style cocktail tables by Gracie.

The paneling in the living room was still washed with its original paint. The marble floors were intact. Ditto the doorknobs, the smoky mirror accents in the dining room, and the sleeping porch, a traditional hot-weather feature that Major often incorporated into his projects, as Lauder discovered when her husband purchased a copy of the architect’s 1926 book about domestic American buildings. She also found an old photo album in a closet that showed period images of the early decor, an echt Palm Beach blend of neoclassicism and rattan and bamboo that was also very much up Lauder’s aesthetic alley.“I am inspired by the past, so embracing the history of the house was important to me. In order to understand the future, you have to understand what came before,” explains Lauder, who launched Aerin, her luxury lifestyle firm, in 2012, after a successful career at her family’s iconic cosmetics company. “So I wanted to preserve as much of the house as possible.” That being said, the property required sensitive but crucial updating, such as adding hurricane windows, rethinking the kitchen, and creating new bathrooms that would nonetheless have a 1930s feeling. Says Lauder, “I wanted them to look old.” New insulation was also part of the program, given that the walls were stuffed with decades-old copies of The New York Times, and the sleeping porch was screened to keep insects at bay.Lauder, in a Victoria Beckham outfit, and Schatzi, a Brittany, in the living room.Bonacina chairs on the loggia.Charles Edwards Hanging Butterfly LanternSHOP NOW AT CHARLES EDWARDSEaton Check by Colefax and FowlerSHOP NOW AT COWTANChelsea Textiles Small Commode with Fluted Carvings$2,886 AT CHELSEA TEXTILESAerin Wildflower Embroidered Cocktail Napkins, Set of 4$150 AT AERINAerin Morton Large Table Lamp$899 AT AERINAerin Beauvais Suede Jewelry Box$850 AT AERINSills felt the same way and supported Lauder’s desire to largely keep the structure as it was; so did architect Jeffery Smith, who handled the renovations.","for Aerin Lauder, the designer, uses the term magical to describe her new getaway in Palm Beach. it’s also the word that the AD100 interior designer uses to describe the project in general.

McMullen,2023-06-20,"Interior designer Zoe Feldman’s skill for blending modern sensibilities with historic architecture was tested when she led the renovation of a town house in the Washington, DC, neighborhood Dupont Circle. Though the exterior of the 1915 building was mostly intact, the interior required work. So much so that Feldman and her clients agreed that trying to salvage much of it would be futile—and prohibitively expensive.“In general it’s our duty to pay homage to history, not just wipe it out completely,” says Feldman, a designer noted for crafting spaces that feel intimate and inviting. “But its also our job to make things feel relevant and modern and that was the goal and the mission with this project.” That aim was accomplished by installing historically accurate recreations in some places, while restoring portions of the 5,500-square-foot home’s Beaux Arts history in others. The result allows jewel-toned fabrics and sculptural furniture to live harmoniously among the structure’s classic architectural details.“The idea was to inject doses of modernism, but without making it feel like the home was put up yesterday,” says Feldman, who collaborated on the two-year project with Thomson & Cooke Architects and Pyramid Builders. “You want to be able to still feel the soul of the building.” Modern updates to the interiors included a fluted kitchen island and walnut perimeter cabinets in the kitchen, hand-painted wall coverings, and white oak custom millwork.The team replaced wood flooring too tattered to rehabilitate with hand-scraped, dark-stained oak that faithfully resembled the original. All of the four-story home’s fireboxes were refurbished, while custom marble mantels were added. Decorative wall paneling was installed to sharpen the contrast with the original arched windows. And some of the antique lighting fixtures were restored while others were modernized to create “great power moments” throughout the home, Feldman shares.The balance of traditional and contemporary is perhaps best displayed in the living room. A 1939 vintage sofa from Denmark in amber velvet sits alongside a blackened iron, clear glass coffee table and a rounded lounge chair. A handmade Calacatta Viola marble side table is juxtaposed with a vintage Northern Italian inlaid walnut side table. Meanwhile, in the entry hall, Horizontal Brushstrokes (More or Less) by Sol LeWitt hangs just above a hand-sculpted walnut squiggle console table that holds an antique ceramic navy blue table lamp. A steel bench with a blackened copper finish by Danish design studio Sofie Osterby adds to the rustic-modern balance.Not far away, a reupholstered Eames chair and ottoman anchor a study bathed in De Nimes, a gray-blue shade from Farrow & Ball. A dining chair in wasabi velvet is tucked beneath a black vellum desk in a room that includes a vintage 1930s rug and a daybed that fits neatly between two bookshelves with brass and black metal wall lights.The clients shared Feldman’s goal of keeping the home’s historic flourishes intact. “It was important that we preserve as much as we could,” says one homeowner, who purchased the property with her husband in 2020. “But we wanted to balance that history with modern touches to make it functional by contemporary standards. I really think we achieved that.”",",,, a blackened iron, clear glass coffee table and a rounded lounge chair. a 1939 vintage sofa from Denmark in amber velvet sits alongside a blackened iron, clear glass coffee table and a rounded lounge chair.

Call it a declaration of decorating independence—the inalienable right of each new generation to reject chintz, midcentury modern, or whatever furniture Mom and Dad picked out back in the day. Married couple Kevin and Nahal Danesh admit that for them, this is absolutely the case. Both born in Iran, as young children they immigrated with their respective families to Los Angeles, where they grew up in the area’s Persian American Jewish community. They were introduced by mutual friends during their senior year of college (he was at UCLA, she was at USC), and, says Nahal, “we’ve basically been together ever since.”Later, as a married couple feathering their nest together, the two realized yet another important commonality. Nahal and Kevin say they had little interest in retreading the type of furnishings they both grew up with—a look they affectionately describe as “very ornate,” “very Louis XVI,” “very gold-accented,” and “very bring-it-from-Iran.”In the family room, a sectional sofa by Twist Custom in a Jab Anstoetz bouclé surrounds a plaster cocktail table from Collected By.“No disrespect intended,” laughs Kevin, an attorney, “but we did not want a home that looked like our parents’!” The houses they admired tended to have clean lines, natural wood, neutral palettes, and plenty of breathing room. “We loved the same kind of serene, modern houses,” says Nahal, a dietitian. The more they looked, the more they realized they were drawn to the work of one architect in particular: Los Angeles–based William Hefner. “His homes feel beautiful and timeless,” notes Nahal. “So we pursued him.”“We 1,000 percent stalked him,” adds Kevin.The couple originally approached Hefner about remodeling their existing home in Beverly Hills, a project he turned down due to its scope. Over the next few years, they periodically checked in with him to see if any of the houses he had built were coming up for sale. (“We almost closed a deal to buy one, but it fell through,” says Kevin.) Finally, in 2018, the couple found an ideal property with a deep, flat lot in Brentwood. “We were like, Thank God! Maybe now we can get William to build us a house!” recalls Kevin.In the living room, a bronze waterfall console separates two camelback sofas by ModShop wearing a Rogers & Goffigon wool. Custom Pierre Talus cocktail tables by Galerie Ground; 1970s Morentz glass-and-brass pendants.The staircase spirals around an Eric Roinestad chandelier from The Future Perfect.Completed in August of 2022, the structure Hefner designed is a classic Mediterranean-style house of brick and stone laid out in an L shape around a courtyard—but with an arresting sleek glass-and-steel wing across its middle. “I loved that Kevin and Nahal were open to trying something different,” says the architect, who describes his imagined narrative of the house as a centuries-old building in rural France updated with a modern extension. “It’s these moments of juxtaposition when things get interesting,” he says. Wide arched passageways, tall arched windows, and monumental glass-and-steel doors that open directly into the backyard and courtyard erase the boundary between indoors and out and flood the house with sunlight. The swooping pearl-white plaster central staircase—a pet project of Nahal’s—is arguably the most impactful statement, providing a sculptural counterpoint to the square lines of the house and emphasizing the connection between the upper and lower levels.","and Kevin Danesh, both born in Iran, are married to a married couple. they say they had little interest in retreading the type of furnishings they both grew up with. the couple initially approached him about remodeling their existing home in Beverly Hills."

magazine,https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/rupaul-beverly-hills-home,Inside RuPaul’s Dramatically Glamorous Beverly Hills Manse,The legendary drag queen tapped AD100 designer Martyn Lawrence Bullard to reimagine the palatial property,Mayer Rus,2023-05-16,"Not since Carlos de Beistegui teamed up with Emilio Terry—or perhaps not since Auntie Mame joined forces with Yul Uhlu—have a client and a decorator been more happily matched than RuPaul Andre Charles and Martyn Lawrence Bullard. RuPaul, of course, is the queen of drag, a revolutionary performer and avatar of glamour recognized around the globe. Bullard, a mainstay of the AD100, is no stranger to enchantment himself—he, too, has built an international reputation based on unapologetic, often outré beauty. When the Drag Race impresario and his husband, rancher Georges LeBar, acquired a Beverly Hills mansion as their new home base in Los Angeles, they naturally called on Bullard, a friend of nearly three decades, to make it pop. “We’ve always loved Martyn’s aesthetic, so we trusted him,” RuPaul says. “I said, ‘Go for it. I can go as far as your imagination will take us.’”And go for it he did. Draping his magician’s cloak over a grand but uninspired residence built in the 1980s, Bullard transformed the property into a fever dream of Hollywood Regency style that bridges old-school Beverly Hills swank and the vivacious, larger-than-life spirit of his client. “This is the house of Ru, a mansion of style designed as the center stage for the world’s most famous and celebrated drag queen. It’s the ultimate runway for the supermodel of the world,” the designer raves, adding, “I could not imagine a more appropriate place for the universe’s drag mother to hold court.”The upholstered seating, cocktail table, and étagère in the living room were designed by Martyn Lawrence Bullard Atelier. The sofas are covered in a Manuel Canovas velvet, and the club chair in Jim Thompson Fabrics malachite pattern. Carpet by Martyn Lawrence Bullard for The Rug Company; window treatments by Martyn Lawrence Bullard for The Shade Store.Working with architect Christopher Hatch McLean, Bullard recast the complexion of the house by modifying the existing mansard roof, reconfiguring railings and colonnades, and adding a host of neoclassical details. As for decorative drama, the slay bells start ringing the moment one steps through the front door into a palatial, powdery-rose entry hall featuring a sweeping stairway with serious Mommie Dearest overtones.

But even with respect to the most energy-efficient buildings, it takes an average of 20 to 30 years to overcome (through efficient operations, such as the use of solar panels and temperature-regulating insulation) the climate impact of construction, per the National Trust for Historic Preservation. With environmental sustainability mirroring the zeitgeist of 21st-century life, it makes sense that creative new methods to repurpose buildings are being implemented across the globe.

web-exclusive home tour,https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/tour-the-perfect-shingle-style-southampton-beach-house-to-dream-about-all-summer-long,Tour the Perfect Shingle-style Southampton Beach House to Dream About All Summer Long,"Using a watery palette to match stunning views, Charlie Ferrer designs a knockout",Sam Cochran,2023-06-21,"For any interior designer, there are projects that play to your strengths, and there are projects that flex new creative muscles. Charlie Ferrer, a seasoned Manhattan-based creative, was eager for a challenge when two longtime clients approached him about their Long Island property. Located in a lesser-known 1960s subdivision of Southampton, the one-acre site directly overlooked the bay—a dream come true for the nautically-inclined couple, who wanted to build a house from ground up. “It was quiet and beachy, fabulous but not fancy,” Ferrer recalls of the waterfront enclave. “I saw an opportunity to do something super special.”Since founding his eponymous firm in 2012, Ferrer has built a reputation for spare but sophisticated interiors, more often than not city apartments where chiseled vintage treasures of wide-ranging provenance mingle merrily with bespoke pieces. This Hamptons project allowed him the chance to work in a fresh coastal idiom, but it also enabled him to work with a longtime design hero, architect Tom Kligerman. (Formerly of Ike Kligerman Barkley, he is now the founding partner of Kligerman Architecture and Design.) “Tom’s synthesis of old and new is very much aligned with my own,” says Ferrer. Kligerman, he knew, would immediately understand his and the clients’ vision of a shipshape contemporary cottage. “He is so good at making a small house feel bigger than it is.”For cues, the team looked to early examples of the Shingle style—that pivotal moment in the early 1880s when New England houses straddled traditional and modern worlds. Cloaked in Alaskan yellow cedar, their design remains classical in thinking yet playfully proportioned, its massing and fenestration undergoing dramatic shifts. Details were reduced to a minimum, so that at times the structure reads as almost abstract, most notably on the front facade where an off-center entrance and oversized window scramble any immediate sense of what’s within. “We all liked this idea of mystery,” reflects Ferrer, noting that while the architecture “twists convention, it all feels right.”The pale blue tones of the mudroom entry can be seen in this powder room as well.The same hue (and paint color) continues into this space.“In some ways it’s a deceptively simple house,” adds Kligerman, citing the straightforward floor plan but complex section, with five levels. In accordance with flood-plain regulations, all the living spaces are raised some six feet off the ground, so that upon entering you must ascend a staircase to arrive in the great room, furnished with multiple seating and dining areas. To one side lies the kitchen and beyond it the family room, whose double-hung floor-to-ceiling windows can transform it into a screened porch. (They call it the Four Seasons room.) To the other side, three successive short flights of stairs lead to the primary suite on one level, a guest suite on the next, and—on the top floor—two additional bedrooms and baths with a shared study. The combined constraints of the site, Kligerman explains, “called for a bento box of a building.” Outside, meanwhile, a vast deck with varied overhangs feels practically boatlike.Throughout the interiors, Ferrer took a furniture-driven approach, beginning with the strong forms of statement pieces. In the great room, those included pairs of Guillerme et Chambron and Joseph André Motte lounge chairs. The interior designer’s first purchase for the kitchen, meanwhile, were two Swedish pendants that had been designed in the 1930s for a hospital. The dining area, meanwhile, is anchored by a bespoke table surrounded by Alvar Aalto chairs. “I am very iterative in my process,” explains Ferrer, who pushed himself with color, embracing a palette of pale lavenders and blues that evoke the sea and sky. “I find building blocks and create a world from there.” He designs, in other words, the way one might collect, layering fixtures, fabrics, and other treasures over time.As proof of the power of collaboration, Ferrer and Kligerman point to the family room’s tiled fireplace surround: a stunner of a hearth that incorporates vintage door pulls in the shape of seahorses and sculptural blocks of red glass. The kitchen’s glass-and-metal pocket doors, inspired by ones at the Ritz Paris, hit a similar Art Deco note. (Their design reappears as doors to the primary suite’s shared shower, accessible from the husband and wife’s separate baths.) The powder rooms, meanwhile, are each artisanal feats, one outfitted with a basin carved from a single block of stone, another anchored by a fluted sink based on a Rosario Candela building.“Partnerships like this are opportunities to push yourself,” says Ferrer, reflecting on the many conceptual challenges afforded by this project. “This is the exact kind of work I am excited to do more of.”A windowside desk is the pièce de résistance of this room with a view.Pale brown can be seen in the woodwork, stone choice, shower curtain, and stool of this bathroom.",", a seasoned Manhattan-based creative, was eager for a challenge when two longtime clients approached him about their property. he was eager for a challenge when two longtime clients approached him about their Long Island property. he was able to work with a longtime design hero, architect Tom Kligerman."

Overjoyed but not at all intimidated by the 12,000-square-foot Los Angeles home, Tranter sees the property as the ultimate symbol of their years spent dreaming big. “As someone who was dropped from four record deals, I do not take my success lightly,” they say. “I do not take it for granted at all.”Tranter has been in the music business for nearly 20 years, first as the vocalist for the alt-rock band Semi Precious Weapons, then as a songwriter for a variety of A-list pop stars including Selena Gomez, John Legend, and Justin Bieber (for whom Tranter cowrote the diamond-certified smash “Sorry,” among other famous tracks). It’s been a winding road to the top, but now they’ve arrived where they always knew they deserved to be. “I basically was at a very lucky, grateful, magical point in my life where my business management [team] said to me, ‘If you ever wanted a crazy house, right now is probably the time to go look,’” Tranter explains. “I was like, Let me go have a fun couple days to look at some insane houses. This was the second house I walked into and I [thought], Oh, I’m moving.”The house as Tranter saw it that day looks much like it does now. The grand structure had just recently undergone a renovation and redesign by Brian Little and Natalie Zudin, who brought the home back to its original grandeur. Built in 1914, the dwelling is classic Hancock Park, which is to say, it’s heavily detailed, opulent, and yet somehow welcoming. “The neighborhood feels kind of majestic and a little transportive,” explains Zudin, who adds of the property itself: “It’s just spectacular. The crown molding is about 18 inches deep. You could feel the richness and the history.”Little and Zudin worked diligently on retrofitting the space inside and out—stripping much of the millwork to reveal historical banisters, doorways, and wainscoting, while redoing the windows and adjusting the landscaping. The furniture, which Tranter purchased with the home, was either vintage or custom-crafted. “We tried to make big comfy sofas where they’re deep and cozy, but instead of doing what people do today [when they] are big and boxy, we would add a beautiful arm, wood frame, or curved back,” Zudin says. “We tried to give it something that felt a little bit timeless and had some history to it.” Along with the furnishings, Zudin and Little employed muralists to hand-paint wallpaper in select areas of the home.After moving in, Tranter wanted to make sure that their personality, and their queer identity, stood out amongst the early 20th-century dramatics. “It was about taking this gorgeous home and making it a lot more queer, both in some ways that are obvious, and also [in those that are less so], like this chandelier that’s a little more fabulous than the chandelier that was [previously] in the dining room. This gives a little more glitz,” Tranter explains of the Foundry chandelier.","the home was built in 1914, and now it’s the ultimate symbol of their years spent dreaming big. songwriter and musician Justin Tranter says the home is the ultimate symbol of their years spent dreaming big. he says the home is a'very lucky, grateful, magical point in my life'"
