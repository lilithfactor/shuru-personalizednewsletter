digital art,https://www.creativebloq.com/features/best-fmv-games,"Wildly inventive and a little cheesy, these are the best FMV games",Jess Kinghorn,The best FMV games include retro revivals and BAFTA-winning artistic achievements. So which will inspire you you create your own video game?,"The best FMV games offer a mix of invention and technical wizardry but just what are they? For the uninitiated who do not share my multi-disc, misspent youth, I’ll first answer the obvious question: 'What is FMV?' The initialism stands for Full Motion Video (remember when that was swish, newfangled tech?), and generally refers to games that feature live action footage. It’s a whole niche that largely shuns computer generated assets in favour of live actors and physical sets.Once upon a time, FMV games were widely regarded as ludicrously expensive, interactive B-movies. But these days you'll need to master the best video editing apps, have a good video camera (you can use an iPhone 14) and now how to out it all together in a game engine or the best digital art software. And while that’s 'cheese' is very much still part of a FMV game's charm, recent years have seen a slew of award-winning indie flicks. For instance, last year developer Half Mermaid took home a BAFTA for their game Immortality – and I’ll cover why a little ways down this list.The best FMV games on either side of the millennium are weird, wonderful, and absolutely wild. Below are ten of the best FMV games of all time, with most theoretically playable on modern hardware.I've played all of these games, and more, and even starred in one FMV game myself as a budding actor (a voice on a phone counts, right?) Also, as the games editor of PLAY magazine, I can tell you plenty qualify as the best FMV games for PS5 too, thanks to backwards compatibility. Read on, this is a list close to my heart.The best mystery FMV gameErica is Sony's big-budget route into the modern FMV genre and really went all in when it comes to production values and talent. Actress Holly Earl plays the titular protagonist, a haunted woman striving to decode all left unanswered in the wake of her father’s murder. Your investigation of the mysterious Delphi House enjoys a wonderful tactile edge as you literally poke and prod at this mystery. Besides engaging twists that’ll send you tumbling down the rabbit hole, this one gets full marks for feature-worthy presentation, including some UI and font use that draws you in rather than killing the atmosphere. Erica even boasts a more traditionally feature length runtime. Bingable in an afternoon, Erica is the perfect summertime chiller.While Erica released on PS4 it's fully playable on PS5, and now is available on iOS and PC too, via Steam. Read our PS5 review to discover why, perhaps, this is the way to best experience Erica.Get it Erica from the PlayStation Store.The best FMV game for pacing and puzzles428: Shibuya Scramble is slightly different from many of the best FMV games on my list, because it uses still photography. Now, I know what you’re thinking: ‘Does a visual novel that predominantly uses still photography really count?’ And I’m going to say yes, because you must unravel this mystery yourself. (You may want to read our guide to the best photo-editing software if you like the sound of 428: Shibuya Scramble.)Weaving between the perspectives of multiple protagonists that have to be seen to be believed – from an amnesiac trapped in a mascot costume to a recycling folk hero – your choices have the potential to cut any one’s story short or unite them in unexpected, often hilarious ways. With a whopping 87 different endings, this is a tangled web worth getting lost in.Get 428: Shibuya Scramble from the PlayStation Store.The best FMV game with ambitionImmortality director and writer Sam Barlow’s latest FMV game asks two questions: 'What happened to the actress Marissa Marcel?' and 'Why were none of her films ever released?' It’s a compelling set up that Immortality absolutely runs with; winning a BAFTA for its narrative in 2022, this one gets a big tick in the 'absolutely wild' category I mentioned before. Barlow’s earlier projects, such as Her Story and the horrifyingly grounded Telling Lies, more successfully nail the 'database detective frame device' that Barlow's games are based on – scour video clips for clues, click and zoom, and link leads to find narrative strings. But while it stumbles a little, Immortality is the game making bigger swings (and more interesting misses), and so remains one of the best FMV games of all time.Get Immortality from the Google Play store.The best FMV game for armchair detectivesContradiction: Spot The Liar! is a little bit Ace Attorney and a little bit Columbo – so what’s not to love? Set in a sleepy English village, the community is rocked by the apparent suicide of a young woman named Kate Vine, and you need to find the killer. Detective Inspector Frederick Jenks smells a rat and, via a fabulously off kilter performance from lead actor Rupert Booth, sets out to unravel a bizarre web of lies. It’s incredibly satisfying to catch suspects out when their stories don’t make sense, and comparing statements makes you feel like you’re genuinely cracking the case.The game is simpler than others on my list, it has some fantastic performances and keeps you guessing. Also, if you're looking to pick up some good video editing tips Contradiction: Spot The Liar! is a great place to start.Get Contradiction: Spot The Liar! from the Steam store.A great horror FMV gamePhantasmagoria: A Puzzle of Flesh is a classic horror FMV game released back in 1996, and is seen as one of the pioneers of the genre. But, okay, I get the 90’s grimdark edge definitely won’t be for everyone – nor will its gore, or its often frustratingly abstract puzzle solutions – but it's a classic worth revisiting. The age and game design kind of works in Phantasmagoria's favour in 2023 (it's a point-and-click interface). Casting a cursor over the top of live action scenes and poking at the blurry edges of reality couldn’t be a more perfect way to represent the unravelling of protagonist Curtis Craig. Phantasmagoria offers a decidedly dated exploration of themes surrounding mental health, but the fleshy mystery at its heart is still a compelling one to unpick. (Fancy creating something similar? Read our guide to creating movie style horror effects.)Get Phantasmagoria: A Puzzle of Flesh from Gog.com.A cult classic FMV gameWith Ripper we are now firmly back in 'Oh my days, what did I just watch?' territory. Featuring an all-star cast (Christopher Walken, Karen Allen, and John Rhys-Davies among them), this sci-fi take on Jack the Ripper first released in 1996. Far from just an interesting relic of the genre’s past, its central mystery features some absolutely bananas twists that are worth witnessing first hand, to say nothing of Christopher Walken’s swaggering performance as Detective Vince Magnotta.Some will argue Ripper isn't technically an FMV game, but rather a game with lots of FMV in it. Kind of dancing on a knife-edge here, but as a game that helped develop the FMV game genre it's undeniable, particularly as even the non-FMV sections were cutting edge 3D, for the time.Read more about Ripper on IMDB.The best FMV game for character designThe 7th Guest delivered stunning and revolutionary graphics when it released 25 years ago. Taking place in a mansion chock full of ghosts and fiendish conundrums, this historical heavyweight lead to no small number of people picking up a CD-ROM drive back in the 90s. The 7th Guest was truly cutting edge for the time. While the design of those aforementioned head-scratchers is definitely dated, the blend of 3D environments with ghostly, live action footage remains visually compelling (and that’s without even getting into the camp charm of the actors’ performances). It’s worth revisiting, especially as a full remake using volumetric video is set to take the Stauf mansion into virtual reality later this year. If you can't wait for that release, take a look The 7th Guest: Remastered for iOS. (Read our guide to the best iPad for gaming, of you do want to play on an Apple device.)Get The 7th Guest from the Google Play store.The best FMV game for Eldritch horrorThe Infectious Madness of Doctor Dekker may not have the same production values as others on my list, but it shows what can be done today with easily accessible tech and a bit of imagination and passion. (For example, read about the best BlackMagic cameras.)One therapist’s couch, six clients, and a whole lot of questions surrounding the demise of their last counsellor - good job you’re here to fill in! This engaging FMV game resurrects another throwback mechanic: the text parser. While a bit of a pain to use on a controller, typing out questions opens up new responses from your patients, often with unpredictable results, and gradually unspools an engaging eldritch mystery. Though rough around the edges, the small, confined scope of this project is absolutely an asset. As mentioned, as an example of what can be achieved these days The Infectious Madness of Doctor Dekker is essential. Developer D'Avekki Studios has built a solid reputation for delivering creative FMV games on a budget, and this is quite inspirational.Get The Infectious Madness of Doctor Dekker from the official website.The best retro FMV gameFor years Night Trap was a joke, a spectre of a time gamers tried to forget. On release 1992 it came under fire for its gamification of voyeurism, which was possibly more to do with people being impressed by grainy, low-res FMV than it was the actual game.The premise behind Night Trap sees a gaggle of teenagers congregate for a sleepover – little do they know the house is full of cameras, booby traps, and vampires. Hopping between security camera feeds, you’re tasked with keeping the youngsters safe, though unfortunately there are an awful lot of blood-sucking blighters to capture. To get the best endings, you’ll need to ignore the most entertaining scenes in favour of watching the shadows like a hawk. Still, it’s cheesy, corny, campy, and responsible for at least one moral panic back in the day; this list simply wouldn’t be complete without it. You can play the remastered edition on most platforms, but I'd suggest getting the Sega Mega Drive Mini 2 for the full 90s experience.Get Night Trap: 25th Anniversary Edition from the Nintendo eStore.The best FMV game for Black Mirror fansBlack Mirror: Bandersnatch is a true-blue interactive movie that anyone with a Netflix subscription can play. It represents the moment when FMV gaming became a mainstream event once again and showed these kind of games are no longer the preserve of genre fans and retro collectors.The Bandersnatch story follows a struggling game developer as he puts everything on the line to create his magnum opus. Naturally, not everything is as it seems (least of all your co-developer, played by Will Poulter). This is suitably Black Mirror-like and based on a the ill-fated Megagames of 80s publisher Imagine Software. (If you like these kinds of games, read our guide to the best retro games consoles.)Light on mechanics, gameplay in Bandersnatch takes the form of timed choices ranging from mundane to existential, and a non-standard narrative structure will keep you guessing as you uncover a plethora of endings. This is a simple FMV game but one with a high production value and Netflix has experimented with more, including Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt: Kimmy vs The Reverend and Carmen Sandiego: To Steal or Not to Steal.Play Black Mirror: Bandersnatch on Netflix. The first FMV games began launching in 1983 when the laserdisc technology became more accessible, and would be found in many video game arcade machines. The first games were Sega's Astron Belt and Dragon's Lair from Cinematronics, animated by the legendary Don Bluth. A limited number of games followed, but included some memorable releases like Firefox, Road Blasters and hologram game Time Traveler.In a video games context FMV stands for full-motion video, and describes the use of video files interspersed into CG for narrative or gameplay purposes. True FMV games only use video files overlaid with a context-sensitive UI and player options. FMV games rely on pre-recorded video files to enable interaction with the player, usually through menus and text prompts but newer FMV games enable you to manipulate the video, images and audio to explore the format of video and film.There are many good tools and apps around these days to create your own FMV game. While you can make any kind of interactive game in Unreal Engine 5, its geared towards photo-real CG and not video, so best to use something like Blender, HitFilm or Unity (via plug-ins like Charles Engine). FMV games are a unique blend of film and video editing techniques and game engine tech to put it all together.",",,,,: 'What is FMV?': 'What is FMV?'

digital art,https://www.creativebloq.com/features/video-games-of-the-80s,I'm inspired by the best video games of the 80s,Martyn Carroll,The best FMV games include retro revivals and BAFTA-winning artistic achievements. So which will inspire you you create your own video game?,"When looking back at the best video games of the 80s it's hard to pin down a definitive list of the key titles that changed how games were made. The list below is personal to me, judged on how they changed game design, art direction and the tech used to create them. These were games often made against a background of no common programming language and where character design relied on pixels and well-placed blocks – yet they still set the pace for future game development. The 80s was the decade when the most exciting and important developments took place in gaming, driven by new tech and innovative software. You can play many of these games on one of the best retro mini consoles, and as a specialist in retro gaming I've played them all over the years. Don't forget, Nintendo Switch has become one of the best ways to play the best retro games too, read our Nintendo Switch vs Nintendo Switch OLED feature for more details.I've selected ten titles (from a potential list of hundreds) that helped shape the gaming landscape of the 80s through advances in art and design. This list is presented in chronological order because, seriously, it would be impossible to rank these works. I also apologise now for no Maniac Mansion, Missile Command or Skool Daze (that name!), but maybe next time.Released: 1980 Format: Atari 2600I’m obviously not championing this entry for its art – your avatar is a small yellow block and the dragons that roam around look like giant ducks. But beneath the surface lies one of the earliest arcade adventures which grew from the idea of visualising Crowther and Woods’ Colossal Cave Adventure and its twisty little mazes. Crucially, the action continues off-screen which helps build a believable world. And all this inside a 4Kb cartridge. Unbelievable. Author Warren Robinett even found space to sneak in a secret room displaying his name, resulting in one of the very first video game Easter eggs.Play it now: The excellent Atari 50 Anniversary Collection, released in November 2022.Released: 1980 Format: ArcadeWhen the arcade industry was busy eating itself at the start of the 1980s, churning out clones of Breakout and Space Invaders, Namco’s Toru Iwatani created a game with real character – namely Pac-Man, the first real ‘star’ of gaming, ably supported by the four named ghosts who chase our hero around the maze (and damn me if Clyde and co aren’t trailblazing some rudimentary AI). Just like that clever pursing AI, Pac-Man introduced a series of firsts and the character’s yellow mug quickly became synonymous with gaming (it ranks No.1 in our list of the best video game logos of all time). Such was the craze he even inspired a hit pop song in 1982. Pac-Man Fever indeed.Play it now: Available in the Namco Museum Arcade Pac for Nintendo Switch.Released: 1981 Format: ArcadeGather around and witness the birth of Mario and Donkey Kong, as well as Nintendo as an unstoppable gaming heavyweight. (Read our feature on the Nintendo logo history.) Riffing on Pac-Man, Shigeru Miyamoto’s game melds memorable characters with a hefty arcade challenge which helped establish the platforming genre. Like Pac-Man, Donkey Kong has become a high-scoring mainstay where fully-grown adults dedicate their lives to becoming 0.01% better than their rivals. Visually, Donkey Kong is a poster child for the arcade era, with the opening ‘barrels’ stage and its sloped girders becoming a quintessential video game image.Play it now: Available for the Nintendo Switch and its eStoreReleased: 1982 Format: ArcadeFor me this Eugene Jarvis creation is the definitive single-screen shooter, elevated to extraordinary heights thanks to its then-unique twin-stick controls: left-hand to move, right-hand to shoot, in perfect harmony, pushing your cognitive skills to their limits. Unlike a lot of games of the era, it’s frantic but never feels unfair, and the gameplay is beautifully balanced. It's also one of the first examples of risk and reward game design – save the humans or kill the aliens to save yourself. Truly elegant in its simplicity with layers of depths, Robotron regularly appears on developers' favourite game lists.Play it now: Available in the Midway Arcade Origins for Xbox 360, playable on Xbox Series S/XReleased: 1983 Format: ArcadeVector games like Asteroids really popped in the arcades. Colour vector games such as Battlezone and Tempest took the tech further. Atari’s Star Wars married colour vectors with the biggest movie franchise around and the result was a game that used a license to enhance the gameplay rather than just hang off it. Those aren’t random spaceships you’re shooting, they’re TIE fighters. That’s no moon, that’s the bloody Death Star. Add in the score and speech from the film, plus a yoke-style flight controller and you have a coin-op that’s now a grail for arcade game hunters. It's testament to the strength of the film's design that a few vector lines can evoke immediate recognition, and even an emotional response. Play it now: The replica Star Wars cabinet by Arcade1UpReleased: 1984 Format: BBC MicroSo far this list has been dominated by arcade games, as that’s where the momentum was in the early 80s. But now let’s head home and talk about Elite, a space sim that was designed to run on the BBC Micro, a home computer with just 32Kb of memory.Within this meagre space, David Braben and Ian Bell utilised wireframe graphics and procedural generation to create a whole galaxy for players to explore and immerse themselves in. With no defined ending, beyond the challenge to achieve ‘elite’ status, this is the most important and influential open-world adventure ever.Play it now: You can download Elite from the Frontier website for freeReleased: 1985 Format: NESIf you had to pinpoint the moment when Mario evolved from everyday hero to worldwide megastar then here it id with Super Mario Bros. the character's first side-scrolling arcade game. Outside of the Mario series, so many tropes of the platform genre can be traced back here that it would be impractical to list them all. Safe to say, Super Mario Bros. set the standard that all subsequent platform games aspired to achieve. It’s possible to complete it in just over five minutes, but memories of Mario’s first foray into the Mushroom Kingdom last a lifetime. (Read our feature on Mario's design secrets to learn more about this iconic character.)Play it now: On Nintendo Switch as part of the NES library (you need an online paid membership)Released: 1986 Format: ArcadeNamco’s Pole Position popularised the pseudo-3D, pixel-art, chase-view racing game, but it was Sega’s gorgeous blue sky racer that we all wanted to play. In many ways OutRun was peak 80s, with the red Ferrari and the blonde passenger and the branching roads which instilled a sense of freedom, suggesting that you could go anywhere, do anything. Yet technically it was so ahead of its time that Sega’s competitors simply couldn’t keep up. It still looks lovely today (read our guides to how to break into pixel art and pixel art Photoshop skills to learn this for yourself). OutRun sounds amazing too. Is there a better tune to accompany a beautiful journey than Magical Sound Shower?Play it now: The Sega Ages version is available on Nintendo Switch eShopReleased: 1989 Format: AmigaIn the beginning there was Populous, courtesy of Peter Molyneux and Bullfrog. Okay, so this wasn’t the first ‘god game’, but it’s the one that I feel established the blueprint that others copied. Despite the huge number of levels (500), and the icon-heavy interface, at its heart Populous is a rather simple game in which you can flatten lands and part seas with the click of a mouse. The crisp isometric visuals are iconic too – you may recall that Royal Mail immortalised the game as part of a retro stamp collection.Play it now: Buy it at GOG.com for less than $5 / £5Released: 1989 Format: Game BoyAlexey Pajitnov’s perennial puzzler has appeared on every system under the sun, but I have to single out the Game Boy version for inclusion here. Nintendo’s idea to bundle it with the fledgling handheld was a masterstroke as it was the perfect pack-in, the ultimate game on the go. Bullet Proof Software’s conversion avoids gimmicks and presents a flawless take on the classic concept that hasn’t really been bettered. All told more than 35 million Tetris carts were shipped, spreading falling block fever dreams the world over. Play it now: On Nintendo Switch, as part of its Game Boy libraryThe easiest way to play retro games today would be on a games console, either via a remasters collection, such as the excellent Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Cowabunga Collection or the SNK 40th Anniversary Collection. If you sign-up to Nintendo's online membership you can play classic games from the NES, SNES, GameCube and N64 for free.Yes, if you love retro games and want to play some of the best emulated games from the 70s, 80s, and 90s then a retro mini console is worthwhile. You can read my Sega Mega Drive Mini 2 review and Amiga A500 Mini review for two good examples.In the early 1980s it was Atari's Space Invaders but this was soon overshadowed by Pac-Man, which was released on almost every screen you can imagine. The term 'Pac-Mania' was coined for a reason. Other trends included laser disc games such s Dragon's Lair, hydraulic arcade cabinets and text adventures such as Zork I: The Great Underground Empire.Nintendo dominated video game sales with four games in the top five, the leader is Super Mario Bros (40.24 million), followed by Tetris on Game Boy (35 million) and Duck Hunt on NES (28.31 million).",: Atari 2600I’m obviously not championing this entry for its art – your avatar is a small yellow block and the dragons that roam around look like giant ducks. But beneath the surface lies one of the earliest arcade adventures which grew from the idea of visualising Crowther and Woods’ Colossal Cave Adventure.

So which will inspire you you create your own video game?,"Looking for the best Dell XPS 17 deals? We’ve got you covered. This premium laptop is ideal for professionals who need colossal power and fast processing to get the job done. The latest iteration of the Dell XPS 17 is the 9720 model, released in 2022, with a 12th Gen Intel Core i7–12700H to support advanced multitasking across several applications, ideal for the creative types and the advanced gamers, making it by far one of the best laptops for working from home. If you’re after something a little more manageable and lightweight, however, consider its predecessor, the super affordable Dell XPS 17 (9710 model) released in 2021 with a not-far-behind 11th-gen Intel Core i7-11800H that would still easily replace your desktop setup and manage hefty workloads with ease. Prices for the Dell XPS range are cheaper than they’ve ever been right now, so it’s the perfect time to bag yourself an amazing deal.  A Dell XPS 17 (9720) with 512GB of storage,16GB of RAM, the latest Intel i7 processor, and an Ultra HD+ resolution display with Windows 11 Pro will set you back $1,985 on Amazon, and that’s including an applied -8% discount on the original listed price which was initially $2,149.97. However, a Dell XPS 17 (9720) with the same exact spec is currently available directly from Dell at a much cheaper price of $1,779 - saving you over $200! Whichever model you choose, we’re here to help you find the best possible price for the Dell XPS 17The best Dell XPS 17 deals on the 9720 modelCPU: : Intel 12th Gen Core i5–12500H or Intel 12th Gen Core i7–12700H | Graphics: : Nvidia RTX 3050 4GB GDDR6 – Nvidia RTX 3060 6GB GDDR6 | RAM: : From 8GB to 64GB | Display : 17.0"" FHD+ (1920 x 1200) or 17.0"" UHD+ (3840 x 2400) | Storage: 512GB to 8TBThis specific iteration of the Dell XPS 17 is a better choice for those who need a lot of power stretched pretty thin. The content creators and work-from-home heroes will significantly benefit from the generous amount of RAM included with this laptop, as well as the mighty NVIDIA RTX 3060 graphics card that can rival even the best laptops for video editing. The Dell XPS 17 (9720) model is at the lowest price ever right now, and you can bag yourself one for as low as $1,299 from Dell if you opt for the cheaper Intel Core i5 processor over the i7, and by downgrading the graphics card to an Intel Iris Xe. But if you prefer not to compromise on quality, then you can still find an amazing deal through retailers like Best Buy which is currently offering the i7 UHD+ RTX 3060 model with 1TB of storage for just $2,099.99! That's a $700 saving.The ultra-high-definition and anti-reflective display on the 9720 model is large enough to be a gaming monitor in its own right. It provides crisp resolution to support you with anything from streaming and photo editing to managing tedious spreadsheets on a larger screen. But keep in mind that although it's a pretty slim and lightweight design, you might need to invest in one of the best laptop bags or a wide enough sleeve to keep it safe and secure.The best Dell XPS 17 deals on the 9710 modelCPU: : 11th-gen Intel Core i5/i7/i9 | Graphics:: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4GB 3050/ 6GB 3060 | RAM:: 8GB /16GB /32GB/64GB | Display: 17.0"" UHD+ (3840 x 2400) or FHD+ | Storage:: 256GB up to 4TBEasily one of the best 17-inch laptops on the market right now, the Dell XPS 17 (9710) is very similar to the Dell XPS 17 9720 model, yet it hugely outperforms its little brother, the Dell XPS 15, not only in screen size but performance too when really put to the test. They both have very similar processors but as is also the case with the Dell XPS 17 9720 model, even the slightest upgrade can make a huge difference.  We found when testing the Dell XPS 17 (9710) that the battery lasted around 5 hours and 45 minutes, which isn't the best, though despite having some tough rivals when first released in 2021, we felt that it manages to hold its own pretty well. Since its release, we've seen a substantial price drop in the 9710 model, available for as little as $1,840 via Amazon compared with its $2,499 launch price. The XPS 17 sports a different cooling system to the XPS 15, which is fitted with a pipe cooling system in comparison with the XPS 17's vapor chamber cooling system which makes all the difference in keeping your system from overheating. It also means that your high-intensity work will put less stress on the internal components of the XPS 17 over the long term, giving it a longer life.What is it that really justifies a good price for one of the best Dell laptops in 2023? Honestly, it depends entirely on the processing power, screen resolution, operating system, and the amount of storage that you’ll need for your device. Prices for the Dell XPS range are cheaper than they’ve ever been right now, so it’s the perfect time to bag yourself an amazing deal.You can of course wait until specific times of the year when we might anticipate a price drop, such as after a newer model has been released, as well as holiday savings that include Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Take a look at our Prime Day Apple deals for early savings. Confusingly, there’s quite a few iterations of the Dell XPS 17 laptop, and it was initially released on 13 May 2020 as the Dell XPS 17 (9700), with a 10th Gen Core i7-10875H and running Windows 10 pro. Then came the next upgrade in the form of the Dell XPS 17(9710) model, which was released almost exactly a year later on 11 May 2021. This replacement offered a better graphics card, improved battery life, and much more power. This model has since been replaced by the Dell XPS 17 (9720) model released in 2022, but wait - there’s an even newer version of this laptop releasing very soon in the form of the Dell XPS 17 (9730) model.We’ll dive into some of the key differences between each of these models below to help you make an informed choice, but if it’s mainly the price that concerns you, it might be wise to opt for one of the earlier models from the list below and save a few dollars by downgrading from the overpowered spec of the new releases.

digital art,https://www.creativebloq.com/reviews/c-smash-vrs-review,C-Smash VRS review: art and arcade collide on PSVR 2,Ian Dean,The best FMV games include retro revivals and BAFTA-winning artistic achievements. So which will inspire you you create your own video game?,"If we’re talking about video gaming with style and immersion at the core then C-Smash VRS and a PSVR 2 feel like a match made in digital heaven. Sony's PlayStation VR 2 has just earned a Red Dot Design Award, while C-Smash VRS is the kind of game my 1980s brian demanded the moment the TRON VHS tape was rewinding.There’s a curious retro attachment to a lot of what makes C-Smash VRS so engaging, and it's why this game made my list of best upcoming PSVR 2 games. C-Smash VRS is a remake of a cult Sega Dreamcast game, now played in VR. It features the kind of simple arcade gameplay championed by Sega's beloved old console, which mixes Arkanoid with squash and a bold, clean visual design that apes how 90s kids thought virtual reality will look.Of course, you’re going to need Sony’s new headset to play C-Smash VRS, so read my PSVR 2 review to catch up on why this deserves a Red Dot Award. Likewise, you’ll need a console, so read my PS5 review where I explain why this remains leader of the pack in 2023. All set? Read on to find out why C-Smash VRS impresses.I love the C-Smash VRS aesthetic; it’s graphic, clean and bright. Set against new PSVR 2 games pushing for realism there’s a freshness to this game’s throwback to the bold, hard lines of 90s gaming. That it remains as immersive as any photo-real VR game, such as Horizon Call of the Mountain, is testament to the physicality of the experience.While C-Smash VRS uses haptic feedback to get you closer to the action, and even makes use of the head-mounted haptics, it’s the simple design touches that really capture the moment and make it feel like you're standing on a glossy sci-fi squash court hurtling towards a black hole. Small design touches, like how you need to reach out for the floating ball and draw it to you to serve make it feel like you're in there.Where the art direction stumbles a little is in its progress ‘tunnel’. Before each session you need to highlight a circular subway-style map, but nothing is explained. At first I plug away and move on, but it becomes evident after some hours of play that inner rings are easy stages, the outer harder, and you can plot a course that suits you. (I understand menu explanations are being added in a day one patch.)So C-Smash VRS looks gorgeous, but how does it play? Well, it’s lovely. The simplicity of this low-gravity setup and coherent, almost natural controls ensures you’ll be on a court smashing and lobbing the little glowing ball in minutes. The nuance stems from flicks and positioning of the Sense Controller, and it picks up small movements, meaning a snap of the wrist sees the ball bend sweetly.This is billed as full body motion, meaning you can lean, bend and stretch for shots, and the ball has a subtle tracking towards you, which ensures it never gets stuck and makes setting shots a little easier. The other hand’s controller is used to strafe left and right. This straightforward approach to movement ensures there’s zero motion sickness and all your efforts are placed on hitting the ball. (Read more experience with PSVR 2 motion sickness to see why the dreaded rumbles can still be a thing, but thankfully not in C-Smash VRS.) Power-ups and drifting patterns ensure blasting blocks need some skill and a little tactical thoughtNow I’ve compared C-Smash VRS to both squash and retro ball and bat puzzle game Arkanoid, which really does sum up what happens on court. Each court is an elongated box, like squash, and at one end blocks appear and you need to clear the room before the time ticks down, like Arkanoid. Shields, bonus blocks, power-ups and drifting patterns ensure blasting blocks needs some skill, and a little tactical thought.There can be some inaccuracy, with shots having an edge of randomness to them, or so it feels. For the most part it’s perfect and sharp, but I was aware of moments where I needed to recenter for greater accuracy. It did also occasionally transfer control from my right-hand to my left, which was kind of awkward in a heated versus match (and that's my excuse).The main game mode to the centre of the galaxy and a weird blocky boss battle is over in around two hours, but the maze-like way to get there ensures you can replay and see new courts and challenges. In true arcade fashion the real goal is not to beat the game but to beat yourself by perfecting your skill, ratings and scores.Likewise, multiplayer is an old-fashioned arcade grand slam. A number of modes are on offer and all play on the same basics that ensures C-Smash VRS feels so immediate. You can battle for control of a court by lighting the most blocks, take aim at your opponent's blocks (winner destroys them all) or my favourite, a duelling mode that elongates the court and you fire balls at one another, the most body blows wins.The simple elegance of C-Smash VRS hides a lot of creative and technical work. Developer Wolf & Wood has assembled an enviable cast of leading artists, musicians and creatives to bring this retro revival to life in PSVR 2. Once again director Jörg Tittel is the guiding hand, their previous VR game, The Last Worker, was the only game selected for the 78th Venice Film Festival, so there's a clear artistic edge to this game. Alongside Rez Infinite’s DJKen Ishii and synth maestro Danalogue, it's easy to find the art on these courts.Should you buy C-Smash VRS? Absolutely. There’s a sense of inventive clarity on display to accompany the advanced tech that has won Sony awards – yes there’s technical wizardry, such as full body immersion and haptic feedback, but this is also a example of how design can be physically manifested using VR; C-Smash VRS is that rare blend of art and arcade, and I love it.","is a remake of a cult Sega Dreamcast game, now played in VR.

graphic design,https://www.creativebloq.com/news/best-mcdonalds-adverts,We wish we'd come up with these McDonald's ads,Rosie Hilder,And they've just won at the Cannes Lions.,"McDonald's is known for its eye-catching adverts. It has an extremely recognisable colour scheme, those Golden Arches and the courage to create playful marketing campaigns that sometimes don't even mention its product.But which are the best McDonald's adverts ever? There are a lot to choose from, from drunken McDonald's messages to an ingenious campaign in France where doors were made to look like fries. One user on Twitter has rounded up what he thinks are the best ones ever, and we've highlighted a few below. Did your favourite make the cut?In the number one spot is this ad for chicken nuggets, which is a simple idea, executed well. It shows the product, and riffs on the cravings people have for said chicken nugget. And the ketchup plus nugget is a subtle nod to the McDonald's colours. (See our why McDonald's uses red and yellow post for more about the brand's colour palette.)At number two, there's a father's day ad, which shows a cup holding hands with two smaller cups. I don't think it has quite the elegance of the nugget, but it's still a clever idea.In third spot is this 'open 24 hours' ad, which shows a burger half in darkness. Again, this is a simple idea. @TheChiefPlug captions it with: ""Principle: Turn every boring announcement into an excuse to be creative."" And we couldn't have put it better ourselves.Skipping further down the list is this iconic campaign from the 1960s, which declares 'look for the golden arches'!

graphic design,https://www.creativebloq.com/advice/start-a-creative-agency,Scared to start a creative agency? We got advice from someone who's done it,Georgia Coggan,Richard Attwater shares seasoned advice.,"If you've always wanted to start a creative agency but fear has held you back, you're not alone. Owning an agency is top of the list of many creative's ambitions, but there is a lot to learn in the process – and not every agency ends up being successful. We spoke to the co-founder of creative agency Sergeant Walnuts, Richard Attwater, to find out about his experience and impart his wisdom. Sergeant Walnuts opened its doors in Manchester, UK in 2022, so the journey is still fresh in Attwater's mind. Here, he gives insight into the pitfalls and successes he, and his partner Gary Toal, encountered along the way. So, read on for 8 top tips for success and remember, if you've got an example of outstanding branding you think deserves an award (from packaging design to print ads and beyond), consider entering the Brand Impact Awards on its tenth consecutive year.I’d always thought I’d like to start my own agency one day, but it was important for me to first garner enough experience at really top-draw agencies, so I felt ready. And then it became a case of ‘now or never’. I felt I’d reached the right age, and had the right level of experience, and so decided to go for it.It’s perfectly possible to enjoy huge amounts of satisfaction working for other people – and I have – but I knew it would feel different when it was my own place. Every client win, or successfully completed project, feel even more rewarding now, and I knew that would be the case.Setting up with my business partner, Gary, was also hugely important. You can’t just start a business with anyone. It had to be somebody who I rated professionally, as a great creative, and also somebody who I consider to be a good friend. We get on, laugh at the same things, and had similar ambitions in terms of what we wanted the agency to be, and so when we realised that (after many conversations) then there was nothing to stop us.It’s easy to say things like ‘create brilliant work’ or ‘we want to win X awards’ but every agency under the sun will say that. We talked a lot about attitude, and ambition, and working with clients of a similar mindset. There’s a lot of extremely mediocre and forgettable creative work out there – and if your work doesn’t get noticed or remembered, it’s all completely pointless. So ‘creating work that commands attention’ became our core ambition (and mantra).We also want to be an agency that’s enjoyable and fun to work for and with. That’s really important to us. We knew we wanted to focus on our core strengths (brand naming/creation, brand identity development, comms) but loads of agencies do that. So then it becomes a case of how well you do them (which is obviously important) and what you’re like to work with along the way – and the second one is often underestimated. If you’re nice, fun, and also good at your job, then you’ll do ok (we hope!).We started with the name – and that’s the hardest brief of all. We considered hundreds, and it took us weeks. We even got as far as buying a couple of URLs, only to change our mind and go back to the drawing board.Gary’s a self-confessed naming geek, and loves the science behind a name. So we talked a lot about that. And we did a lot of looking at other agency names, to see if we could find obvious patterns to avoid - we were keen to practice what we preach (stand out rather than blend in) and avoid any well-trodden paths or clichés.Loads of (brilliant) agencies have cool one-word names (e.g. Anomaly, Bulletproof) but good luck trying to find a meaningful word that hasn’t already been taken. Then there are bucket loads of agencies who pick a ‘colour and animal’ (Google it, pick any colour/animal combination and I’m willing to bet good money there’s an agency using that name). So, we reverted to things we love for inspiration, and we’re both big fans of Bob Mortimer. He occasionally puts lists of cat names for sale on twitter (for £8) and when scanning the list Sergeant Walnuts immediately jumped out. It fitted really well with our mantra of ‘creating brands that command attention’ and is unlike any other agency name we’ve heard of. Plus, it made us smile. So we posted the £8 off to Bob (we stuck 8 pound coins to a card using Sellotape like your Aunty used to) and that was that. We also bought some artwork, (made using Bob’s cat names) to adorn our office walls.The brand design work came relatively easy after that. If you use a good designer, they’ll design you something good, so we asked one of our designer friends to help us and we think he nailed it.Luckily, [the process has] been fairly smooth sailing. We had a number of potential clients lined up, and projects we thought we’d get, and most of them have come to pass. Apart from wrestling with the agency name for longer than we’d planned, it’s all gone pretty well.The curveballs have all been things relating to outside of work – and suddenly you realise how closely entwined your personal and private lives have become. I had to unexpectedly go into hospital for five nights for a tooth problem (I’m fine now, thanks for asking) and only then do you realise there’s not a huge team around to pick up the slack like in my previous agencies. If you’re not around to do something, everything stops. Gary and the other creatives stepped in to do as much as they could, but you realise how, in bigger agencies, there’s safety in numbers.Gary too – who has been living in the Northeast – was expecting to sell his house so he could be down here in Manchester, and we could get our agency office sorted. But the house sale fell through, and so office plans got delayed. So there have been little hiccups like that, which is just life I guess.Naturally, we wouldn’t have been in the position to start Sergeant Walnuts had we not spent many years working at other agencies, experiencing things, and learning from talented people. I’ve worked at all sorts of agencies: ginormous to tiny; advertising and design; networks and independent; B2C and B2B; Manchester and London based. I’ve learnt something at every one of them.I frequently think of particular people I’ve worked with – be they an amazing creative director, or strategic planner – and ask myself ‘what would they say?’ or ‘how would they handle this?’ if I find myself in a tricky spot. You’re only as good as the people who’ve taught you, and I’ve been lucky to spend a lot of time with some brilliant people over the years.I’ve definitely learned a lot since we launched, but one of the key things is how lucky I’ve been to have worked with such a diverse mixture of people at previous agencies. When you start something new, suddenly you’re MD, financial manager, account exec, talent booker and producer all at once. If something needs doing, you have to do it yourself. So in a typical day, I’m doing new business calls one minute, speaking to packaging suppliers the next, then doing project timing plans at the end of the day whilst trying to cook dinner. It’s not always glamorous, but you don’t mind doing it as it’s your place, and you’re building something. For somebody looking for advice as to how to run a successful agency, I’d probably direct them somewhere else! We’re only nine months in, so we’ve a long way to go before we can be considered successful.But in terms of getting as far as we have, there are definitely a few key things. Firstly, you need to have conviction, and be sure that starting your own thing is definitely what you want to do. It can be tough and stressful at times. I really took my time to think about whether it was what I wanted to do, and waited until I felt I had the right level of experience to run my own place (20 years working in a variety of creative agencies). But if your mind’s made up, then throw everything you’ve got at it, and don’t look back.Get an accountant before you do anything else. There are so many things you don’t know you don’t know – from how to register a business at Companies House, to tax and insurance – and a good one will take care of all of that for you.Have some savings in the bank before you begin is another big one. When you start out, you need to first find the clients, then do the projects, then send the invoices, and then wait at least a month to be paid. So there’s going to be a good few months where there’s very little coming in, and quite a lot going out. Some kind and thoughtful clients let you bill a certain amount upon appointment, so really push for that and try and get your cashflow going early doors.Finally, just cross your fingers and hope for the best! You can do everything right, and plan all you want, but ultimately you’re in the lap of the Gods – and you need a bit of luck to help get you going.It still feels like we’re just getting started, so we’re trying not to look too far ahead. Many new agencies don’t make it past the first couple of years, so we’re just focussing on working hard, and trying to build a reputation for ourselves as an agency that does good work (and is fun to work for and with).Then if we get that right, in 15 years or so, hopefully somebody will come and buy us for millions and millions of pounds, and Gary and I can go and live in big castles (next door to each other, like Ant and Dec). Check out Sergeant Walnut's website here, and for more inspiration see our list of the best design portfolios around.","to start a creative agency, but fear has held you back, you're not alone.

Although many of the well-known characters from cartoons, advertising and films look straightforward, in actual fact, a vast amount of effort and skill will have been exerted to make them so effective.From Mickey Mouse's famous three-fingered hands (drawn to speed up production when he was first developed for animations in the 1920s), to the elegant simplicity of Homer Simpson, character design has always been about keeping it simple. To explore Disney's techniques further, see our guide to the brand's 12 principles of animation.But what do you need to consider for your character design? Aside from clean lines and easily readable features, there's knowing what to exaggerate and what to minimise, how to give a hint of depth and background and what to do to develop personality.Then, of course, there's the matter of the technicalities of how to draw your character design. If it's going to be used in motion or as part of a comic strip, you'll need to make sure it works from any angle.For this article, we asked a range of leading artists and illustrators their advice on creating memorable, unique character designs. Many of these tips come from Pictoplasma, an annual character design festival in Berlin. To start making your own creations, you'll probably want some software – get Adobe Creative Cloud to get cracking.Many character designers will start their project with a sketch. And most agree designers agree this is often where the essence of the character is captured. So when you're working up your design, make sure you don't lose that magic.""I try to stick to my original drawing style, because the instinct is to try and clean it up,"" says Laurie Rowan. ""I don't like to feel like I've created by characters; I like to feel like I've kind of just encountered them.""""When starting out on your character design, don’t get caught up in the details,"" says Pernille Ørum. ""Decide what you’re trying to communicate, then create loose sketches with movement, acting and flow. As soon as you start to tighten up the drawing, you’ll automatically lose some of the dynamic, so it’s important to have as much life in the early stages as possible. Movement is all but impossible to add later, so make sure it’s in the initial sketch.""While inspiration needs to come from somewhere, the aim is to create something original. So Robert Wallace – known as Parallel Teeth – suggests not having the reference material right in front of you as you work. ""If you look at something and then you try and hazily remember it in your mind, that's when you end up making something new, rather than a pastiche of something,"" he says. Above you can see Wallace's new take on well-known festive figures, created for a Hong Kong department store.For guidance, it can be helpful to try and deconstruct why certain character designs work and why some don't. There's no shortage of research material to be found, with illustrated characters appearing everywhere: on TV commercials, cereal boxes, shop signs, stickers on fruit, animations on mobile phones, and more. Study these character designs and think about what makes some successful and what in particular you like about them.""When you work with characters you need to be inspired,"" advises Ørum, ""and you can do this through research. Your mind is a visual library that you can fill up. Try to notice people around you – how they walk, their gestures, how they dress – and use that in your design.""It's also a good idea to look beyond character designs when hunting for inspiration. ""I like birds' mating rituals a lot,"" laughs Rowan. The odd movements can spark unique character behaviour. ""When I begin a project, I often start with the feeling I want to evoke,"" he adds. The process begins with the designer taking videos of himself as a reference, trying to capture something of the character idea's movement or posture. Other inspirations include ceramics – an organic texture and muted colour palette stop his work feeling too clinical – and folk costumes.Isabel Armitage suggests creating your characters a playlist of their favourite songs. ""This can be a great tool to help you understand the emotions of your character and begin revealing their likes, dislikes and guilty pleasures, all of which will help you layer on a good narrative,"" she says.""Not only will this help your art, but it is a fun activity that I find is a great way of breaking up my day,"" she adds. Read more of Isabel Armitage's tips for developing a character here.It's easy to subconsciously let our favourite designs influence us. Cornelia Geppert, CEO of indie games studio Jo-Mei, is a huge fan of The Last Guardian, with its unique aesthetic and great video game character designs.At one point one of her team members had to say to her that their Sea of Solitude design was looking a little too similar to The Last Guardian. She looked back at her initial artworks, and it brought back the feeling she had when creating them. The project shifted back on track.Exaggerating the defining features of your character design will help it appear larger than life and exaggerated features will also help viewers to identify the character's key qualities. This is key in cartoon caricatures and helps emphasise certain personality traits. If your character is strong, don't just give it normal-sized bulging arms, soup them up so that they're five times as big as they should be.The technique of exaggeration can be applied to characteristics, too. Anna Mantzaris' hilarious Enough film (above) shows everyday characters in mundane situations, doing the things we've all dreamed of doing on a bad day. ""I think it's fun with animation that you can push things further, and people will still accept it as real,"" she says. ""With live action it would look absurd. You can also push the emotion further.""Think about your audience. Character designs aimed at young children, for example, are typically designed around basic shapes and bright colours. If you're working for a client, the character's target audience is usually predetermined, as Aussie artist Nathan Jurevicius explains.""Commissioned character designs are usually more restrictive but no less creative. Clients have specific needs but also want me to do my 'thing'. Usually, I'll break down the core features and personality. For example, if the eyes are important then I'll focus the whole design around the face, making this the key feature that stands out.""Whether you're creating a monkey, robot or monster, you can guarantee there are going to be a hundred other similar creations out there. Your character design needs to be strong and interesting in a visual sense to get people's attention.When devising The Simpsons, Matt Groening knew he had to offer the viewers something different. He reckoned that when viewers were flicking through TV channels and came across the show, the characters' unusually bright yellow skin colour would grab their attention.Another good way to make your character distinct and improve its pose, says Ørum, is to turn it into a silhouette. ""Then you can see how the character ‘reads’ and if you need to make the gesture more clear. Do you understand the emotion of the character and see the line of action? Can things be simplified? Try not to overlap everything, and keep the limbs separate.""One key aspect to consider when creating a character design is the line of action. This is what defines the direction of your character, as well as being a useful narrative tool and bringing a feeling of movement. ""Try to bring the line of action all the way out to the extremities,"" says Ørum. ""A ballet dancer is a good example: they emphasise the line from the tips of their toes to the tips of their fingers. The line of action is also easier to see in creatures with fewer limbs, which is why mermaids are an ideal subject for developing a strong line of action.""Geppert's Sea of Solitude video game is an exploration of her experiences of loneliness. Intensely personal though it may be, the game hit a chord with audiences because it deals with an experience that is so universal yet still strangely taboo. ""The best art is based on personal experiences. People can relate better if it's based on the truth,"" says Geppert. ""It's not a made-up story, even though it's based in a fantastical setting.""Félicie Haymoz has worked with Wes Anderson on both of his animated features: Fantastic Mr Fox and Isle of Dogs. When embarking on a new character design, Haymoz likes to start by finding the individual's posture. This element can start the ball rolling on the whole feel of the personality. ""I try to capture the stance of the character. Are they hunched over, or are they sitting straight and proud?"" She also notes the face is important to get right. Read more of Haymoz's film character tips here.The drawn lines of which your character design is composed can go some way to describing it. Thick, even, soft and round lines may suggest an approachable, cute character, whereas sharp, scratchy and uneven lines might point to an uneasy and erratic character.Ørum recommends balancing straight and curved lines. ""Straight lines and curves gives your character design a rhythm. A straight line (or a simple line) leads the eye quickly, while a curved (or detailed line) slows down the eye.'It's also worth considering the balance between stretch and compression. ""Even a neutral pose can lead the eye by applying these two approaches, resulting in an effective character design,"" says Ørum.Rowan grew a name for himself by sharing humorous clips of his characters on Instagram, and went on to work on projects for Disney, the BBC and MTV, and earned himself a BAFTA award and nomination in the process. However, it was his less successful years doing standup comedy that provided inspiration for his trademark character animations. ""It's through standup I learned brevity. It's kind of a joke structure,"" he explains. Knowing how to frame the clip comes from past failures and successes on stage: ""You very quickly learn how to hit certain points,"" he laughs. As well as knowing when to exaggerate, Ørum is also keen to highlight the importance of simplicity. ""I always try to communicate the designs with the fewest lines possible. It doesn’t mean that work hasn’t been put into creating the volume, placement and design of the character, but I try to simplify as much as possible and only put down the lines and colours that conveys the necessary information.""Depending on what you have planned for your character design, you might need to work out what it will look like from all angles. A seemingly flat character can take on a whole new persona when seen from the side if, for example, it has a massive beer belly.In the Character Design Crash Course workshop at Pictoplasma 2019, Jurevicius and Rilla Alexander asked attendees to sketch their character in poses held by other attendees, life drawing style. And if you're going to turn it into a comic strip, a la Luke Pearson's Hilda, it'll need to not only make sense from all angles, but look good too.""How to draw Hilda from behind without her hair swallowing her silhouette"", how to draw her beret from above; a long and drawn out battle with how her nose should look… these were all issues Pearson had to deal with when creating his character. The problems all ultimately led to design solutions. If your character is going to exist within a 3D world, as an animation or even as a toy, working out its height, weight and physical shape is all important. Alternatively, go one step further and create a model. ""Even if you're not someone who works in 3D, you can learn a lot by converting your character into three dimensions,"" says Alexander. It's a key part of the process the students follow at the Pictoplasma Academy. See our best 3D modelling software guide to get started.Colours can help communicate a character's personality. Typically, dark colours such as black, purples and greys depict baddies with malevolent intentions. Light colours such as white, blues, pinks and yellows express innocence and purity. Comic-book reds, yellows and blues might go some way to giving hero qualities to a character design.""To choose effective colours, it’s important to understand the basic rules of colour,"" explains Ørum. ""Become familiar with the primary, secondary and tertiary colours, as well as monochromatic and complementary colours. One technique for generating an effective colour palette is to chose two complementary colours and work with them in a monochromatic colour scheme.""""You’ll create balance because complementary colours create dynamism, while monochrome colours invoke feelings of calm. You could also try a tertiary colour scheme, which adds a third colour (for example, violet, orange and green), and then work with monochromatic versions of those colours, but it demands more planning and skill for it to work well. If you’re new to colour, try and keep it simple.""To read more on this, see our post on colour theory.""Some years ago I went from hating drawing hair to loving it,"" Ørum. ""Previously, I used to view working out all the details and directions of the hair as a tedious endeavour. Now I think of it more as a large, organic shape, which like a flag in the wind indicates and emphasises the movement of the character or its surroundings.""Start by creating a large shape and divide it into shorter sections, while thinking about where the hair is parted and where the hairline is. Every line should help to define the volume, shape and direction of the hair.""Props and clothing can help to emphasise character traits and their background. For example, scruffy clothes can be used for poor characters, and lots of diamonds and bling for tasteless rich ones. Accessories can also be more literal extensions of your character's personality, such as a parrot on a pirate's shoulder or a maggot in a ghoul's skull.Expressions showing a character's range of emotions and depicting its ups and downs will further flesh out your character. Depending on its personality, a figure's emotions might be muted and wry or explosive and wildly exaggerated.""When you know the basics of drawing a face, play with the expression of the character,"" says Ørum. ""Use a mirror to read your own face and notice the subtle changes. Push and pull the eyebrows to show emotion. Avoid giving the face symmetry. The mouth will always favours a side and it gives life to the drawing. And give the head a tilt to add nuance.""Classic examples of exaggerated expressions can be found in the work of the legendary Tex Avery: the eyes of his Wild Wolf character often pop out of its head when it's excited. Another example of how expressions communicate motions is deadpan Droopy, who barely registers any sort of emotion at all.The driving force behind a character's personality is what it wants to achieve. This missing 'something' – be it riches, a girlfriend or solving a mystery – can help to create the dramatic thrust behind the stories and adventures your character gets up to. Often the incompleteness or flaws in a character design are what make it interesting.If you're planning for your character design to exist within comics and animations, then developing its back story is important. Where it comes from, how it came to exist and any life-changing events it has experienced are going to help back up the solidity of, and subsequent belief in, your character. Sometimes the telling of a character's back story can be more interesting than the character's present adventures.""If you’re experiencing problems when attempting to nail the essence of a character, try thinking of them in a certain situation,"" Ørum advises. ""Use the story to think about your character’s emotions before tackling the design, and add the details afterwards. Setting the scene is the best help when staring at a blank piece of paper, and it makes the process more fun, too!""Yukai Du is not what you'd call a typical character designer: none of her work features faces. Instead, her body part of choice is the hands. Having found she wasn't good at capturing specific emotions within a facial expression, she turned to a different body part: the hands. ""Hands are very expressive. You can tell a lot of stories with hands, and do it in a very subtle way,"" she says. Hands became her way of telling stories. Having decent software and materials to work with is useful, but not essential, when it comes to bringing your character to life. A lot of amazing characters were successfully designed years ago when no one had personal computers and Photoshop CC was just a dream.If you character is really strong, you should be able to capture it with just a pen and paper. Or, as Sune Ehlers puts it: ""The character should still be able to work with a stick dipped in mud and drawn on asphalt.""Show people your creations and ask them what they think. Don't just ask whether they like them or not. Instead, see if they can pick up the personalities and traits of your characters. Find who you think is the suitable or ideal audience for your work and get feedback specifically from them about it.""A lot of my commercial project come out of my personal work. That's why I try to make my personal work so honest to what I like. I think it comes through to the viewer that I'm not just ticking boxes,"" says John Bond. The illustrator launched his debut picture book, NOT LOST, based on his Mini Rabbit character design.In the same way that you create a history for your character, you need to create an environment for it to help further cement believability in your creation. The world in which the character lives and interacts should in some way make sense to who the character is and what it gets up to.Question each element of your creation, especially things such as its facial features. The slightest alteration can have a great effect on how your character is perceived.Illustrator Neil McFarland advises: ""Think about the meaning of the word 'character'. You're supposed to breathe life into these things, make them appealing and give them the magic that will allow people to imagine what they're like to meet and how they might move.""Hilda has changed over the years, from book to book, but Pearson explains that no one has pulled him up on it. ""I like to think it means the design is strong enough to withstand being pulled in all these different directions,"" he says.

graphic design,https://www.creativebloq.com/logo-design/where-find-inspiration-7133517,Where to find logo design inspiration,"Emily Gosling,",Richard Attwater shares seasoned advice.,"Unfortunately, logo design inspiration can be difficult to find. Just imagine: you have received a brief from a new client, and now you're tapping your fingers waiting for inspiration to hit you. Are you expecting the perfect logo design to magically appear, fully formed, in your mind? If so, you'll likely be in for a long wait.Seeking out inspiration takes proactivity. If you soak up a variety of ideas, gradually they'll come together to form the logo you're looking for. The only trick is knowing where to find your inspiration in the first place.Below you'll find some suggestions of places you can look for logo design inspiration (check out this list of top logo design to get you started, or perhaps you feel ready to dive in with one of the best logo designers). Further down the page, you'll find some tips for kickstarting your logo creative process (use the jump link above to get there). However, this can never be an exhaustive list because inspiration can come from anything and anywhere at anytime.Behance is an online gallery for designers, packed full of design projects including a wide variety of high quality, creative logos. It's a brilliant place to go for inspiration – just search using keywords. Logoed is a single-page archive that’s sole purpose is to present beautiful logo designs. Its simple vertical scroll makes it simple and easy to navigate, and as you move down the page more projects are automatically loaded onto the screen. Simply click on each thumbnail for more information on each project and a wider selection of images.Logospire takes a similarly simple, infinite vertical scroll format and pares it back even further, offering just a single image and a link to the designer’s website. Without any other clutter, it's easy to spot the logos that stand out for you.Brand New is part of graphic design platform behemoth Under Consideration, and offers information on logo design trends, showcases imagery and offers advice on great logo design. It also offers critiques of the latest logo designs.LogoLounge (at the time of writing) offers a whopping 412,515 different logo designs to peruse. The site was created for designers to offer an efficient reference library and also facilitates discussions around related topics and the chance to share ideas and concepts with peers and clients.Logo Moose has a daft name, and an ironically daft logo. However, it’s a helpful no-nonsense online logo design inspiration community, which showcases work from professional designers worldwide. Designers can submit their own logo designs to be showcased and take advantage of the platform’s possibilities for critique and feedback.Logo Design Love is a site and book from graphic designer David Airey. Unlike some of the more overwhelming logo inspiration sites out there, the platform is thoughtfully laid out and showcases newer works alongside classic designs by the likes of Adrian Frutiger, Cruz Novillo and Paul Rand. Its considered content offers opinions, insight and news on everything logo-related, from celebrating the past to commenting on the contemporary.If you've searched all the sites and are still a bit stuck, try these tips for kickstarting your logo design.Cast your net far and wide. Don't just look at the top best logos ever (although that's not a bad place to start). You need to also look beyond that, at design in general and at the wider world. Whenever you see something that stands out or appeals to you, for whatever reason, file that thought. Let it inform your design process and contribute as your new logo starts to evolve.Sometimes you can overthink these things and end up getting nowhere, so why not cut your conscious mind out of the loop and instead let the creativity flow, unguided, with a bit of random doodling? You may well end up with a page of pointless scribbles, but somewhere in the disjointed mess of lines, you might spot something that fires up that essential spark of inspiration.Check out all the various logos your client has employed since the company was founded. This can be particularly interesting if they go back for many decades. You may be able to hark back to the past, if the client would like to position itself as a heritage brand, or you might be able to radically overhaul tits original logo into something fresh and modern. This has the advantage of built-in continuity even as you present a new image. See our post on how to reawaken a brand's heritage here.Discuss with your client its plans for the future – what does it envisage for the next 12 months or the next five years? Are there changes of direction imminent or new products coming that could have some bearing on the logo you design? You need to future-proof the logo because businesses do change over time.Take, for example, Carphone Warehouse: no-one buys carphones any more – so should it lose a highly successful brand that has taken years to build by changing its name to something more appropriate?While it makes perfect sense to get as much information as you can from the client, sometimes there's nothing quite so helpful as a fresh pair of eyes. If you have some ideas worked up, take them to a friend who has absolutely no connection to the project, and see what they think. Often someone's untainted opinion can be just what you need to fire the imagination.Mood boards and brainstorms can help you to straighten out your thoughts and mix up different images and ideas of all shapes, sizes and themes. Play with keywords and synonyms and gather a multitude of inspirations from different sources onto a single mood board to see how they combine.It's probably a fair guess that for every logo you design you probably come up with a couple of dozen sketches before you decide which one to develop further. Never throw away these early ideas, as they form a valuable resource. Just because one of your early sketches didn't work for a previous client, it doesn't mean it won't work at all. Go back through previous work that you've created but not used and you may find the seed that, with a bit of nurturing, could grow to become the logo you're looking for.Scroll through Google Images and Pinterest on both related and unrelated subjects to your client's logo needs. Then add the results to your mood board. Pick a colour here, a shape there, a word, a typeface... then see how these different ideas could work together.At the end of the day, inspiration can strike anywhere, at any time. Be receptive to the ideas that flow through your mind. Sketch something as it comes to you and then revisit it later to see how it might work within the parameters of your brief. At these early stages of the design process you need to allow your creativity full rein. Give yourself plenty of ideas to work with and then take the best elements from each and discard the rest.If you've tried everything and nothing's coming up, don't try to force it. Take a break and let your brain get on with other things. Go to see a film, play some video games, cook a nice meal or just have a lovely nap. It's amazing how just getting away from the problem at hand and thinking about something else can result in a sudden flash of exactly the right kind of inspiration.There's no point just waiting for inspiration to hit. The more you search it out, the easier you'll find it. You'll develop an eye for what works and what doesn't, and how you can apply this to your own nascent designs.Read more:","inspiration can be difficult to find.

art,https://www.creativebloq.com/advice/understand-the-12-principles-of-animation,Understand Disney's 12 principles of animation,Tammy Coron,Richard Attwater shares seasoned advice.,"Disney's 12 principles of animation may have been created several decades ago, but they remain just as relevant today. Technology may have evolved, with much animation now done digitally, but these 12 basic rules of animation apply to almost any type of project, not just movie animation and cartoons.These principles of animation were first published in 1982 in The Illusion of Life: Disney Animation, written by animators Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas. They painstakingly examined the work of leading Disney animators from the 1930s onwards and broke down their approach down to 12 basic principles of animation.You can use the Disney principles of animation as a starting point for your animation work, for animating characters for example (see our character design tips). But the rules also have relevance for areas like UI animation and CSS animation for interfaces or websites.In this article, we take a closer look at each of Disney's principles of animation. To see them in action, you could consider signing up to Disney Plus, and you can try them out in your own digital work using the best tablets for animation paired with the best animation software.This article features GIFs from Vincenzo Lodigiani, who also made the short video The Illusion of Life (below).The squash and stretch principle is considered the most important of the 12 principles of animation. When applied, it gives your animated characters and objects the illusion of gravity, weight, mass and flexibility. Think about how a bouncing rubber ball may react when tossed into the air: the ball stretches when it travels up and down and squishes when it hits the ground.When using squash and stretch, it's important to keep the object's volume consistent. So when you stretch something it needs to get thinner, and when you squash something it needs to get wider.Anticipation helps to prepare the viewer for what's about to happen. When applied, it has the effect of making the object's action more realistic. Consider how if might look if you were to jump in the air without bending your knees, or perhaps to throw a ball without first pulling your arm back. It would appear very unnatural (it may not even be possible to jump without bending your knees!). In the same way, animating movements without a flicker of anticipation will also make your motion seem awkward, stale and lifeless. Staging in animation is a lot like composition in artwork. What we mean by that is, you should use motion to guide the viewer's eye and draw attention to what's important within the scene. Keep the focus on what's important within the scene, and keep the motion of everything else of non-importance to a minimum. There are two ways to handle drawing animation: straight ahead and pose to pose. Each has its own benefits, and the two approaches are often combined. Straight ahead action involves drawing frame-by-frame from start to finish. If you're looking for fluid, realistic movements, straight ahead action is your best bet.With the pose to pose technique, you draw the beginning frame, the end frame, and a few key frames in-between. Then you go back and complete the rest. This technique gives you a bit more control within the scene and allows you to increase the dramatic effect of the motion.When objects come to a standstill after being in motion, different parts of the object will stop at different rates. Similarly, not everything on an object will move at the same rate. This forms the essence of the fifth of Disney's principles of animation.If your character is running across the scene, their arms and legs may be moving at a different rate from their head. This is overlapping action. Likewise, when they stop running, their hair will likely continue to move for a few frames before coming to rest – this is follow through. These are important principles to understand if you want your animation to flow realistically.The best way to understand slow in and slow out is to think about how a car starts up and stops. It will start moving slowly, before gaining momentum and speeding up. The reverse will happen when the car brakes. In animation, this effect is achieved by adding more frames at the beginning and end of an action sequence. Apply this principle to give your objects more life.When working in animation, it's best to stick with the laws of physics. Most objects follow an arc or a path when they're moving, and your animations should reflect that arc. For example, when you toss a ball into the air, it follows a natural arc as the effects of the Earth's gravity act upon it.Secondary actions are used to support or emphasise the main action going on within a scene. Adding secondary actions help add more dimension to your characters and objects.For instance, the subtle movement of your character’s hair as they walk, or perhaps a facial expression or a secondary object reacting to the first. Whatever the case may be, this secondary action should not distract from the primary one.For this principle of animation we need to look to the laws of physics again, and apply what we see in the natural world to our animations. In this case, the focus is on timing.If you move an object more quickly or slowly than it would naturally move in the real world, the effect won't be believable. Using the correct timing allows you to control the mood and the reaction of your characters and objects. That's not to say you can't push things a little (especially if you're creating an imaginary world) – but if you do, be consistent.Too much realism can ruin an animation, making it appear static and boring. Instead, add some exaggeration to your characters and objects to make them more dynamic. Find ways to push the limits just beyond what's possible, and your animations will pop.You need to understand the basics of drawing. This includes knowing how to draw in three-dimensional space and understanding form and anatomy, weight and volume, and lights and shadows.While you can push the limits here, too, it's important to remain consistent. If your world has wonky doors and a warped perspective, keep that perspective throughout the entire animation. Otherwise, things will fall apart.Your characters, objects, and the world in which they live need to appeal to the viewer. This includes having an easy-to-read design, solid drawing, and a personality.

graphic design,https://www.creativebloq.com/inspiration/7-best-car-logos-of-all-time,10 of the best car logos on the road today,Nick Carson,Discover the fascinating stories behind some of the world's most recognisable car logos.,"The best car logos are widely recognised, and in most cases all over the world. Some of them may have details that people have never noticed (such as Alfa Romeo's man-eating snake), but most of them are aided in their recognisability by their relative simplicity. Emblazoned on the front (and back) of one of the most expensive single purchases most people make, the best car logos become badges of pride, as well as signifying quality of design and engineering. Many are over a century old now in their origins, but in recent years we've seen many of the best car logos redesigned to make them flatter an simpler, with 3D effects and gradients removed for a versatile streamlined design.Below, we explore the stories behind ten classic car logo designs that have stood the test of time (with a few tweaks). See our pick of the best logos overall for more inspiration, and see our guide to how to design a logo).The BMW logo is simple and instantly recognisable, sporting the blue and white of the German company's home state of Bavaria. The current version, unveiled in March 2020, is a flat reimagining of the previously metallic emblem with the outer ring made completely transparent, and the 3D and lighting effects have been removed to create a minimal new look.The clean, modern design initially drew some scepticism online, but it's been proven to work well in both physical applications as well as digital, earning a place in our pick of the best car logo redesigns. It adapts to new technology but acknowledges the brand's heritage.Mercedes-Benz's three-pointed star is another powerful statement of efficient German engineering and premium quality, but its roots are rather more charming. In 1872, Gottlieb Daimler, technical director of petrol engine manufacturer Deutz, drew a star above his house on a postcard of Cologne and sent it to his wife, vowing that one day the symbol would adorn his own factory.Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft trademarked that three-pointed star as its logo in 1909. Following a merger in 1926, the company was renamed Mercedes-Benz and acquired the Benz laurel wreath, which became a simple ring in 1933. Mercedes-Benz doesn't just make cars, of course – and the three points are said to represent motorised dominance of the sea, air and land.Enzo Ferrari first saw the prancing horse that would later adorn his sports cars on the side of a First World War fighter plane, flown by Italian pilot Count Francesco Baracca. Baracca's parents urged Ferrari to use the symbol as his logo to bring him luck, as they believed it had for their son. He did, when founding the Scuderia Ferrari racing team in 1929 – adding canary yellow to honour his home city of Modena.If luck translates into profitability, it certainly paid off – nowadays, Ferrari-branded merchandise brings in almost as much cash as the cars. Count Baracca, however, was not so fortunate as he was later killed in action. As a mark of respect, Ferrari made the horse black – rather than red, as it was on the plane – to mourn the ace pilot that inspired the iconic logo.The latest version of the  Citroën logo achieved a seeming contradiction in that it somehow looks both more modern and more traditional than the previous design. The company went back to its original logo from 1919, which had two chevrons inside an oval. With a few tweaks and a more modern colour palette, the result is a logo that's both leaner and more in keeping with the brand's heritage. The chevron's themselves are said to have been inspired by the double herringbone-shaped Polish metal gear system of the early 20th century. Founder André Citroën discovered the system during a visit to his family in Poland and bought the patent to use it in France.This one's a bit more controversial because some people think the Cadillac logo is way too chaotic, and the decision to drop its colours in favour of a black-and-white design has divided fans. But we think it deserves a place among the best car logos, because the fact that it's so unusual actually makes it work.The story behind it is also bizarre. Many car logos were inspired by regional crests, and the Cadillac logo follows that trend in a way. Back in 1902, it decided to use the family crest of French explorer Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac, who founded the city of Detroit in 1701.However, De la Mothe Cadillac's crest was entirely made up. Even his name wasn't real. He adopted it when he enlisted in the military at the age of 24 to give the illusion that he hailed from high society. When he arrived in the New World, no one could check his origins, so Cadillac assembled an invented coat of arms from various sources. He chose three coloured bands to represent boldness, virtue and valour.  The original design also incorporated a crown, a wreath and several merganser ducks. Those elements were reduced down over the years, but it's still one of the more complex car logo designs on the road.Symbolising speed, strength and power, the leaping jaguar is a hugely distinctive and highly energetic addition to our list of iconic car logos. It is usually depicted in simple yet refined colours such as black, metallic grey and gold – intended to represent elegance, integrity and high-performance, as well as class and sophistication.A highly distinctive jaguar ornament use to be seen leaping from the hood/bonnet of classic Jaguar cars, but pedestrian safety regulations mean they are no longer permitted. The wild cat remains in the brand's logo, however, even after the rebranding of its parent company (see the JLR logo controversy).Swedish manufacturer Volvo is another carmaker that has chosen to flatten its logo, taking the shine out of its previous metallic design. Love or hate the new look, there's a fascinating tale behind the logo, and it's one steeped in mythology and ancient symbolism. The Volvo logo is the symbol of the Roman god Mars, long associated with war and weaponry, but it's also the alchemist symbol for iron and symbol of masculinity.Volvo needed a badge that lived up to its reputation for safe, sturdy and reliable vehicles, and it adopted the circle with upward-pointing arrow in the 1920s. The name 'Volvo' itself means 'I roll' in Latin, although the association with wheeled vehicles is fortuitous because this actually refers to the company's original output: ball bearings.Even a quick glance at the Alfa Romeo logo is enough to tell us there's a decent story behind it, and you wouldn't be wrong. As we saw in our guide to the best logos with crowns, the red cross on the left-hand side is the symbol of Milan, home of the Italian car maker, and on the right is a man-eating snake.Otone Visconti, a knight from the former ruling family of Milan who fought in the First Crusades, is said to have taken the symbol from the shield of a Saracen he defeated in battle. Alfa Romeo, however, claims that rather than being eaten, the man is in fact emerging from the snake, purified and renewed in a symbol of rebirth.Sometimes the history behind the best car logos is a little cloudy, as is the case with the 'bowtie' marque adopted by American carmaker Chevrolet. There are three different versions of its origin story, from three different members of the family of company founder William C. Durant.Durant himself claimed the design was inspired by wallpaper in a French hotel, and this version was upheld in Chevrolet's 50th-anniversary publication. According to his wife Catherine, a 1911 newspaper advertisement for 'Coalettes' fuel was the source of inspiration. Meanwhile, their daughter Margery, claimed Durant simply sketched out a nameplate design in a moment of inspiration ""in between the soup and the fried chicken"" one evening.Chevrolet itself acknowledges the uncertainty, with its 100th-anniversary publication stating that logo's true origin is unknown.Last on our list of the best car logos is Britain's Aston Martin. Sleek and elegant, the Aston Martin logo was reworked by Peter Saville in 2022 to slim it down. Saville replaced the gradient background with a solid racing green and ditched the fussy semi-circular line on the wings, which seemed no longer necessary. It was a relatively subtle transformation but it made the logo look more modern while avoiding a design that feels flat and lifeless. This one also got a mention in our piece on the good, the bad and the ugly of car logo rebrands.","the BMW logo is simple and instantly recognisable, with 3D effects and gradients removed for a versatile streamlined design. Mercedes-Benz's three-pointed star is another powerful statement of efficient engineering and premium quality. Mercedes-Benz's three-pointed star is another powerful statement of efficient German engineering and premium quality."

Stunning pieces can be found in all kinds of environments, from urban centres to wastelands, and they can be bold and thought-provoking or fun and irreverent. Below, we've gathered together some of the work of our favourite street artists. You'll probably find some talent you already know but perhaps also some less-known artists that you don't. The artists' motivation ranges from simply brightening up their neighbourhoods to making political statements.

We've rounded up 50 talented street artists and their most emblematic pieces to provide some inspiration. You can click on the icon at the top-right of each image to enlarge it.The best street art is often bold, striking and rebellious in spirit. But it can also be poignant and moving, as demonstrated by London-based artist Ant Carver. He works out of a studio in Whitechapel but also paints street art in the UK capital, including the piece Love Me/Love Me Not, which is part of a series exploring different forms of loss. Carver followed up this piece with Love Me/Love Me Not Part II at Copeland Park in Peckham (see below).A post shared by Ant Carver (@antcarver)A photo posted by onPainted in New South Wales by colour enthusiast and environmentalist Scott Nagy and Krimsone, this mesmerising piece was painted as part of the Walk the Walls festival in Cronulla, Sydney, in 2019. It captures the wonder of nature, with the girl captivated by the creatures surrounding her – so much so that she becomes part of the scene. The more you look at it, the more there is to see, with the colour palette drawing you in.Self-taught artist Rasmus Balstrøm painted his ""Stay Safe"" as ""a quick Corona burner"" while in LA (he is from Copenhagen). With a message to stay safe, he said  ""what a pleasure to finally paint before we have to flee the country"" on his Instagram.Koh Hooi San (Caryn Koh) is a Malaysian artist, who used to work in the medical field. According to the aritst, this piece, Connections, is about ""the attachments we have and the new ones we build"". We love how the figure of the woman is painted across the containers, connecting them together.Martin Ron is an Argentine street artist whose work is prolific in the capital Buenos Aires. He specialises in large-scale pieces that surprise passersby and take them into fantasy worlds. You can find his work throughout Buenos Aires, including on the underground metro system, but perhaps his tallest and most dramatic piece is outside of the city in the suburb of Banfield: two giant murals measuring 50 metres and 65 metres. One depicts a boy looking up at a heart-shaped balloon, recalling the work of Banksy, and the other shows a girl standing on a balloon as she completes a wall made of coloured bricks.Hazard, aka Harriet Ford, is a British street artist whose work is recognisable from its bold, peaceful depictions of women with detailed hair and headdresses. Sonora (2017) was painted on a warehouse in the abandoned mining town of Ajo on the Arizona/Mexico border. This was part of a crowdfunded project, designed to create a dialogue through an arts residency in a significant place at a significant time. With a headdress decorated with wildlife from the Sonoran desert, the female character represents a peaceful Mexican lady.The 16th Avenue Tiled Steps is a community project completed in 2005. Inspired by the famous Selarón steps in Rio de Janeiro, the neighbourhood residents chose artists Aileen Barr and Collette Crutcher to collaborate in a design across 163 mosaic panels. The steps have a sea to sky theme and the local residents sponsored handmade tiles in the shapes of the animals, fish and shells. Three mosaic workshops were held within the community so that everyone could assist in the creation of this stunning street art.Los Angeles-based artist Cryptik is notable for his calligraphic approach to street art. Much of his work is based on ancient sacred texts and eastern philosophy, with echoes of the intricate geometric patterns found in Muslim art and architecture. It's all rendered with an unmistakable street art twist, making for a perfect blend of ancient and modern. His aim is to help humanity evolve towards greater awareness and understanding.This colourful portrait of David is the work of Eduardo Kobra, a Brazilian street artist from the south side of São Paulo. The design is painted directly onto the marble at a quarry in Carrara, Italy, where Michelangelo and other artists found the marble used in their sculptures. Kobra has been a graffiti artist since he was a teenager, and in 2016 his mural for the Rio Olympics scored him a record for world's biggest mural – a record he's since broken.London-based artist Dean Stockton (also known as D*Face) creates work inspired by things he loved as a child – skate graphics, album art and cartoons – and some of his work is clearly indebted to pop artist Roy Lichtenstein. One such example is Behind Closed Doors; and epic piece of street art found on the side of the Plaza Hotel in Las Vegas. The design cleverly uses the shape of the building to give the mural an added sense of depth.The Harreman Project, by Barcelona-based Reskate Studio, uses glow-in-the-dark paint to create street art with hidden depths. Each piece of artwork in the series shows one image during daylight hours, while another is revealed when it gets dark. ""The intention is to try to light up dark corners of cities, both installing new lights and encouraging citizens to interact with the wall, painting with light on it,"" reads the description on the studio's website. This piece, Asombrar, was created for Fisart Romania in 2015.Antonio Segura Donat, or Dulk, grew up copying illustrations of exotic animals from his parents' old encyclopaedias, and used to take his sketchbook everywhere with him. Having studied illustration then graphic design, today he works as a multidisciplinary artist tackling drawing, painting, sculpture and advertising, but it's his large-scale street art, featuring surreal creatures in imaginary landscapes, that really stands out.Mobstr is a multi-talented street artist with a strong line in fake billboards, but it's his Progressions that we really love. Documented across a series of photos, he plays fantastic mind games with the poor souls whose job it is to clean graffiti off the streets, using little more than stencilled letters.Glasgow-based street artist Smug specialises in photorealistic graffiti, and the Scottish city has become his infinite canvas thanks to a council-funded mural initiative. After picking up a spray painting can over a decade ago, the artist has developed a unique and mesmerising style – rendered entirely freehand. His meticulously detailed work can be seen transforming walls all over the UK and Europe, as well as Australia.The culture capital of Chile, Valparaiso is the home of many a talented artist, including Mario Celedon. Best known for his incredible street art, Celedon's colourful and detailed paintings can be seen in various locations around the city, but our favourite artwork has got to be the intricate illustrations on these steps.Lithuanian artist Ernest Zacharevic brings fine art techniques to the great outdoors. Exploring a multitude of mediums, from installation and sculpture to oil paint, stencils and spray paint, Zacharevic's experimentations remove the restriction of artistic boundaries.Based out of Penang, Malaysia, the artist first grabbed global attention in 2012 after creating a series of murals for Georgetown Festival, resulting in the BBC dubbing him Malaysia’s answer to Banksy. Since then, his Georgetown murals have become cultural landmarks and his work can be seen from Singapore to LA.Italian street artist Manuel Di Rita, who goes by the moniker Peeta, is known for his 3D graffiti. Using gradients of colour, his 2D street art gives off the impression of multiple dimensions, creating the illusion it is sculpture, rather than paint. On top of this, the artist creates actual graffiti-inspired street art sculptures.Since he first started creating street art back in 1993, Peeta has travelled the globe, spending a lot of time in both Canada and the US. After gaining plenty of experience as a graffiti artist in Europe and America, he started painting canvases and now runs his own business selling canvases and sculptures.Sheffield-based Phlegm started out in self-published comics before bringing this detailed illustration style to the streets. The UK artist creates surreal, storybook-style imagery, working solely in monochrome. Each piece of street art forms part of a grand narrative that extends worldwide, from Canada to Australia.MrDheo has no formal artistic training, and it's this that he believes has helped him to develop his own techniques and evolve without direct influences. The Portuguese artist's bold, graphic style lends itself to graffiti art; the bigger the better. MrDheo's street art appears in over 30 international cities, and he has collaborated with a number of major brands and companies.Boston based artist Matt W Moore – who runs MVM Graphics – has been painting on walls for over half his life. ""It's a magical experience to actualise an idea extra-large in the public space,"" he smiles. ""Lots to see in this section. Everything from my early years of graffiti and street-level art, to my more recent abstract murals. Indoor and outdoor, I've got you covered.""This impressive piece of street art was created to mark the opening of the Urban Nation contemporary art museum in Berlin. It's the work of visual artist Mademoiselle Maurice, and features a flock of 3D birds brought to life in metal origami. Herbert Baglione is a Brazilian street artist. One particularly striking project, entitled 1000 Shadows, saw him add his stamp to an abandoned psychiatric hospital in Parma, Italy.

There is stunning detail in the physicality of the eye itself, and hidden within the reflected image.Though J.D Hilberry admits he originally wanted to be a musician rather than an artist, he has become a master of realistic pencil drawings. Hilberry's website contains many stunning examples of his work, as well as tutorials and tips to help you to create your own artistic drawings. In the above video, Hilberry talks through some of the process behind his self-portrait pencil sketch, which is based on the idea of an artist putting themselves back together again after being torn apart by critics.

Each piece is a pencil sketch and by using the tool he dubs a humble instrument, he created the Interlude series by drawing portraits of models when at their most serene, in comfortable environments. Nawell II (above) is one of those pencil drawings. Okafor explains on his website: ""I love to draw faces. Each face tells me an intriguing story regardless of age, gender, race or background... I visually dissect facial features. I study them and then I put them back together again like pieces in a puzzle.""CJ Hendry mostly worked in black and white creating pencil drawings related to popular culture (such as this Chanel bottle) until her collaboration with Christian Louboutin in 2017. Complementary Colours was created entirely using coloured pencil, though you'd be forgiven for thinking, instead of creating a pencil sketch, she had just squirted a massive dollop of paint onto the wall.

Nigerian artist Arinze Stanley has had a long time to practise his stunning pencil art; he's been at creating artistic drawings since the age of six.

""These objects and scenes in my drawings are thus meticulously detailed to create the illusion of a new reality not seen in the original photo.""Cath Riley's artistic drawings are amazing to look at, but she regards her hyperreal work as just a stage in her ongoing evolutionary process of exploration and development.

Although he also works with oils, Mersmann is best known for his intense naturalistic graphite drawings. His work has been featured in more than 150 exhibitions and has won him over 30 awards.""The very act of drawing every branch, twig, highlight and shadow, rendering textures from the extreme winter skins to the silkiness of new-fallen snow, transforms the scene into an intimate journey. This undertaking is considerably different than merely taking a photo or simply being there,"" he explains on his site.""The drawing process immersed me for hundreds of hours, interpreting and translating what I saw and felt from hundreds of reference photos, collected branches, twigs, and revisits to the site.""Entitled Sensazioni (sensations, in English) this mind-blowing pencil drawing was created by artist Diego Fazio. Over a period of roughly 200 hours, Fazio drew this intricate piece, which we still – no matter how long we look at it – cannot believe is a drawing.

""I'm pleased with the piece as it personally represents a big leap in scale, detail and patience,"" he says. ""It is roughly twice the size of my previous work and I learnt a lot working on this beast.""""Hyperrealism in my work displays the beauty of the imperfections perfectly, opening a door within the subject that is not normally depicted in real life,"" says Italian artist Giacomo Burattini, who drew this unusual portrait.""I believe reality is a beauty in itself so I don't need to find ways to hide the imperfections of human nature so my work shows the perfection of the imperfections of life.""Burattini found an audience by sharing his pencil drawings on Tumblr, Facebook and Instagram, where he regularly shares his works in progress.

Huber comments on her site, ""Drawing in the style of realism is what I love to do, to recreate life as we see and know it with just a simple pencil is exciting to say the least.""UK-based artist Ken Lee is the man behind this stunning pencil drawing. He was inspired to draw this image, based on the Hunger Games blockbuster Mockingjay (Part 2), as a follow up to a Spider-Man 3 drawing that earned him plenty of fans.The level of detail in this – from the mockingjay bird to the fire effects – proved to be a particular challenge.

I need a long break now!""Martijn Versteeg is an artist from The Netherlands, who appears to have a soft spot for Audrey Hepburn, judging by the number of portraits he has drawn of the film star.But, more importantly, he also has massive amounts of talent in the art of pencil drawing.

digital art,https://www.creativebloq.com/reviews/c-smash-vrs-review,C-Smash VRS review: art and arcade collide on PSVR 2,Ian Dean,"Serving up a Dreamcast cult classic in VR, is this PSVR 2's first multiplayer hit?","If we’re talking about video gaming with style and immersion at the core then C-Smash VRS and a PSVR 2 feel like a match made in digital heaven. Sony's PlayStation VR 2 has just earned a Red Dot Design Award, while C-Smash VRS is the kind of game my 1980s brian demanded the moment the TRON VHS tape was rewinding.There’s a curious retro attachment to a lot of what makes C-Smash VRS so engaging, and it's why this game made my list of best upcoming PSVR 2 games. C-Smash VRS is a remake of a cult Sega Dreamcast game, now played in VR. It features the kind of simple arcade gameplay championed by Sega's beloved old console, which mixes Arkanoid with squash and a bold, clean visual design that apes how 90s kids thought virtual reality will look.Of course, you’re going to need Sony’s new headset to play C-Smash VRS, so read my PSVR 2 review to catch up on why this deserves a Red Dot Award. Likewise, you’ll need a console, so read my PS5 review where I explain why this remains leader of the pack in 2023. All set? Read on to find out why C-Smash VRS impresses.I love the C-Smash VRS aesthetic; it’s graphic, clean and bright. Set against new PSVR 2 games pushing for realism there’s a freshness to this game’s throwback to the bold, hard lines of 90s gaming. That it remains as immersive as any photo-real VR game, such as Horizon Call of the Mountain, is testament to the physicality of the experience.While C-Smash VRS uses haptic feedback to get you closer to the action, and even makes use of the head-mounted haptics, it’s the simple design touches that really capture the moment and make it feel like you're standing on a glossy sci-fi squash court hurtling towards a black hole. Small design touches, like how you need to reach out for the floating ball and draw it to you to serve make it feel like you're in there.Where the art direction stumbles a little is in its progress ‘tunnel’. Before each session you need to highlight a circular subway-style map, but nothing is explained. At first I plug away and move on, but it becomes evident after some hours of play that inner rings are easy stages, the outer harder, and you can plot a course that suits you. (I understand menu explanations are being added in a day one patch.)So C-Smash VRS looks gorgeous, but how does it play? Well, it’s lovely. The simplicity of this low-gravity setup and coherent, almost natural controls ensures you’ll be on a court smashing and lobbing the little glowing ball in minutes. The nuance stems from flicks and positioning of the Sense Controller, and it picks up small movements, meaning a snap of the wrist sees the ball bend sweetly.This is billed as full body motion, meaning you can lean, bend and stretch for shots, and the ball has a subtle tracking towards you, which ensures it never gets stuck and makes setting shots a little easier. The other hand’s controller is used to strafe left and right. This straightforward approach to movement ensures there’s zero motion sickness and all your efforts are placed on hitting the ball. (Read more experience with PSVR 2 motion sickness to see why the dreaded rumbles can still be a thing, but thankfully not in C-Smash VRS.) Power-ups and drifting patterns ensure blasting blocks need some skill and a little tactical thoughtNow I’ve compared C-Smash VRS to both squash and retro ball and bat puzzle game Arkanoid, which really does sum up what happens on court. Each court is an elongated box, like squash, and at one end blocks appear and you need to clear the room before the time ticks down, like Arkanoid. Shields, bonus blocks, power-ups and drifting patterns ensure blasting blocks needs some skill, and a little tactical thought.There can be some inaccuracy, with shots having an edge of randomness to them, or so it feels. For the most part it’s perfect and sharp, but I was aware of moments where I needed to recenter for greater accuracy. It did also occasionally transfer control from my right-hand to my left, which was kind of awkward in a heated versus match (and that's my excuse).The main game mode to the centre of the galaxy and a weird blocky boss battle is over in around two hours, but the maze-like way to get there ensures you can replay and see new courts and challenges. In true arcade fashion the real goal is not to beat the game but to beat yourself by perfecting your skill, ratings and scores.Likewise, multiplayer is an old-fashioned arcade grand slam. A number of modes are on offer and all play on the same basics that ensures C-Smash VRS feels so immediate. You can battle for control of a court by lighting the most blocks, take aim at your opponent's blocks (winner destroys them all) or my favourite, a duelling mode that elongates the court and you fire balls at one another, the most body blows wins.The simple elegance of C-Smash VRS hides a lot of creative and technical work. Developer Wolf & Wood has assembled an enviable cast of leading artists, musicians and creatives to bring this retro revival to life in PSVR 2. Once again director Jörg Tittel is the guiding hand, their previous VR game, The Last Worker, was the only game selected for the 78th Venice Film Festival, so there's a clear artistic edge to this game. Alongside Rez Infinite’s DJKen Ishii and synth maestro Danalogue, it's easy to find the art on these courts.Should you buy C-Smash VRS? Absolutely. There’s a sense of inventive clarity on display to accompany the advanced tech that has won Sony awards – yes there’s technical wizardry, such as full body immersion and haptic feedback, but this is also a example of how design can be physically manifested using VR; C-Smash VRS is that rare blend of art and arcade, and I love it.","is a remake of a cult Sega Dreamcast game, now played in VR. C-Smash VRS is a remake of a cult Sega Dreamcast game, now played in VR. It features the kind of simple arcade gameplay championed by Sega's beloved old console. It mixes Arkanoid with squash and a bold, clean visual design that apes how 90s kids thought virtual reality will look."
3d,https://www.creativebloq.com/reviews/adobe-substance-3d-stager-200,Adobe Substance 3D Stager 2.0.0 review: still growing,Paul Hatton,"Serving up a Dreamcast cult classic in VR, is this PSVR 2's first multiplayer hit?","The most recent addition to the Adobe 3D toolset is Substance 3D Stager. For the most part, Adobe has focused its 3D efforts on material authoring with the release and development of Painter, Sampler and Designer, giving it a foot in the door of the 3D universe. Painter enables artists to texture assets using brushes, Sampler converts images into 3D materials, and Designer is an authoring tool used for material creation.This new release supersedes the Dimension package and is directly aimed at designers and 3D artists. Through the use of physics-based tools, artists can create brand visualisations, product mockups and much more.If I’m honest, I was surprised to see Adobe go down this route. The 3D market is saturated with countless modelling and rendering apps, many of which are streets ahead in terms of functionality and quality. It seems their intention isn’t to compete with these behemoths, but to be completely different. They’ve certainly got history of that, as seen with Painter.Stager adopts the approach of trying to make the bar to entry as low as possible, while still providing a high level of functionality and quality. This, for the most part, has been achieved. Stager is intuitive and incredibly easy to pick up. It will no doubt appeal to designers who have no interest in learning a complicated package but still want to show designs off in all their glory. It will also be appealing to artists creating portfolio renders, marketing adverts, and product design interactions.Stager will be most suited to those already invested in the Adobe ecosystemDespite Stager’s new approach, it’s certainly not without competition. One example is KeyShot; a well-established renderer that has the capability of creating jaw-dropping visuals. The main benefit Stager has is how it fits into the broader Adobe ecosystem. Stager, alongside Substance, and followed by Photoshop and Illustrator, provides an incredibly powerful set of tools that work seamlessly together. Being able to connect your materials and rendering into one workflow makes it highly appealing indeed.As a result, Stager will be most suited to those already invested in the Adobe suite of tools, and who want a way to push the boundaries of their work. Its connection to Adobe’s material authoring solutions helps to make it even more powerful and boosts its offering to 3D creators.Stager can import and export using the USD file format. This makes it incredibly compatible because it can be integrated into any other workflow that supports the format. Through USD, creatives can move around these scenes, including geometry, materials, cameras and lighting, in a flexible way.Of course, the first step is to build your scene. Stager contains several intuitive tools that make setting up scenes quick and straightforward. There’s also a handy physics tool that enables models to collide with other objects. This is perfect for creating scenes that look naturally set up.When setting up your designs, Stager gives a helping hand by providing thousands of top-quality assets created by Adobe for use in its products. These assets include models, materials and lights.After your scene is set up, you can apply and edit materials using simple menus that are designed for ease of use. The real benefit of this is that it’s all in real-time, so there’s no waiting around for renders to be calculated. This is a perfect solution for working collaboratively with designers. All of this rendering is powered by Adobe’s Mercury render engine.Aside from creating renders, it’s also possible to publish work to both the web and augmented reality (AR). The ‘Export to Aero’ functionality enables designers to send their work over to Adobe’s bespoke AR tool, Aero. With Aero, creators can build, view and share their work. This export feature is robust and links up seamlessly with Aero, ensuring the scene is perfectly prepared for use in an AR environment.Adobe Substance 3D Stage 2.0.0 costs £40/$50 monthly or £440/$550 annually (part of Substance 3D CollectionStager lacks the functionality you’d expect from other rendering applications, but is perfect for small-scale designers and artists keen to show off their work.

reviews,https://www.creativebloq.com/reviews/caldigit-thunderbolt-4,CalDigit Thunderbolt 4 review: the ultimate dock for your laptop?,Tom May,"Serving up a Dreamcast cult classic in VR, is this PSVR 2's first multiplayer hit?","Dimensions: 5.55 x 1.65 x 4.46 inches (141 x 42 x 113mm)Weight: 1.41 pounds (0.64kg)Operating system: Windows 10/11, macOS 11.4+Ports: 3x Thunderbolt 4 (one host), 3x USB-C (10Gbps), 5x USB-A (10Gbps), DisplayPort 1.4, 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet, 3.5mm combo in/out, 3.5mm out, 3.5mm in, SD card reader (UHS-II), microSD card reader (UHS-II), Kensington lock slotMax video resolution: 8K or dual 4K @ 60HzPower delivery: Up to 96W for host laptop, up to 20W for front USB-C, up to 7.5W for other USB-C and USB-A portsGenerally in life, you get what you pay for. Which means that broadly speaking, if you spend a lot of money on a laptop, it'll be better than a cheap one. In a few areas, though, this isn't always the case. And one of these is connectivity. These days, the best laptops tend to be the thinnest ones. Yet while these lightweight laptops are fantastic in terms of portability, and often super-stylish, they don't usually pack in many ports. So if you want an ultralight laptop with the very best processor, screen, speakers and so on, but need to connect up multiple devices, what do you do? In short, you need a docking station, which plugs into one of your laptop's USB-C slot and then gives you a bunch more. Choosing the best docking station is very much a balance between how much you want to spend and how many ports you need. The CalDigit Thunderbolt 4 dock lies at the far end of that spectrum: it's very expensive and it provides a LOT of ports: 18 in total. But is it right for you? I've spent time with a review model to find out.The CalDigit TS4 Thunderbolt comes in a solid, robust and somewhat imposing (in a good way) aluminium box. At over two-thirds of a kilo, it feels a bit weighty and clunky for travel, but that's not really what it's for. It's clearly been designed for permanent use on a desk packed with devices. The sides are ribbed, which is mainly to dissipate heat, but also helps it looks pretty stylish at the same time.The dock can be used in horizontal and vertical positions, and rubber feet keep it nice and stable in the case of the latter. Crucially, all the ports are ergonomically positioned so you'll have no problems using every single one of them concurrently. And I didn't just take their word for this but gathered together an army of gadgets to test this claim out. Encouragingly, I had no problem fitting everything into the slots at once – none of the leads or plugs got in the way of each other – or servicing all the devices simultaneously.The CalDigit Thunderbolt 4 requires its own power source. So as well as the main dock, you also get a power adapter in the box, and it's a real brick; both large and weighty. So if you're short on space and/or trying to streamline your setup as much as possible, that may be a downside to consider. Also, be aware there's no switch on the box, so you'll have to remember to switch off the plug at the wall once you've finished work for the day.As well as the adapter, you also get an 80cm USB-C to USB-C cable, which lets you connect the dock to your laptop. That'll be long enough for most people and certainly was for me. It's also nice that the cable is detachable because if it stops working or gets damaged, it'll be pretty straightforward to replace.As the name suggests, the CalDigit Thunderbolt 4 supports Thunderbolt 4, the latest and fastest protocol for data transfer. However, if you have an older laptop that uses Thunderbolt 3 or just plain USB-C, don't worry: everything's backwards-compatible.There are so many ports here, it's best just to list them all individually. They are, in no particular order:Most of these ports are on the back for ergonomic reasons, as you can see in the image below:CalDigit have put a few of them on the front, though. And to my mind these are the ones that make most sense to appear there: two 10Gb/s USB-C ports, one USB-A port, the two UHS-II card slots, the 3.5mm combo audio jack, and the Kensington security lock.Note that you can use the dock to charge your devices directly using either the USB-C or USB-A ports, even if there's no laptop connected. Plus if your laptop itself is out of juice, the dock can also supply to 98W of power to it. Finally, you can daisy-chain up to six Thunderbolt devices, including extra Thunderbolt 4 hubs, so this thing is super-flexible, basically.The main omission here is that there's no HDMI port. Yes, you could connect an HDMI adapter to either the video port or one of the Thunderbolt 4 ports, but it's a bit of a faff considering how expensive this dock is.There's no doubt about it: this is the best Thunderbolt dock money can buy in 2023. And if money is no object, we can't think of a reason not to buy one. But unfortunately, most of us have to watch the pennies. So the question becomes: is this $399.99 / £399.99 that the CalDigit Thunderbolt 4 currently sells for a good investment for your money?Ultimately, the answer to that question depends on what your needs are. If you're unlikely to ever connect more than four or five things to your laptop simultaneously, we suggest you look for something more basic and affordable. Our best dock roundup is an excellent place to start.Conversely, suppose you're a software engineer, web developer, video producer or similarly techie professional who often needs to connect between eight and 16 devices to your laptop at once, including monitors, mice, SSD drives, SD cards and audio equipment. In that case, you'll love this sophisticated dock. Partly because of its extensive range of ports, but also because it's well-made, flexible and ergonomically designed to fit in with most desk setups.",: 5.55 x 1.65 x 4.46 inches (141 x 42 x 113mm)Weight: 1.41 pounds (0.64kg)I've spent time with a review model to find out.

Unison pastels including BG 7, BG14, Green 20. Conté Crayons, blues, purples and pale green. For this tutorial, I am using soft pastels and Conté crayons for drawing, rather than painting. There is always a debate about whether pastels are a drawing or painting medium, but I think it depends entirely on the way you use them. Here I will be using limited colour to capture the energy and texture of natural forms by changing my mark making and feeling for the flow of line. As I draw each piece, I hold it in my hand to feel its weight and use other senses as well as sight. I want to convey more than just what it looks like. What does it feel like? Is it hard and spiky, and heavy to hold? Or light and fragile, and easily crushed in my hand?Whatever the subject matter might be, we can convey all of those sensations with the quality of our marks. To stock up on materials, see our best pastel pencils, best pencil sharpeners and best easel guides.Pastels and Conté crayons vary in hardness. To test out how they behave, do lots of experiments, pressing as hard as you can, then just letting the pastel graze the surface of the paper. See how they smudge. Notice how some make an intense mark, others are subtle. You can use these variations to get great contrasts in your work.Think about the weight and energy of your subject. Hold it in your hand, feel it with your fingers, then draw what it feels like as well as what it looks like.There are so many different ways that you can draw with pastels or Conté crayons. I break my sticks in half and use them on their ends, twisting and turning; on their edges for linear work; and on their sides to make broad, sweeping strokes. By alternating all of these as you draw, your pastel can dance around the surface.If you want to practise your drawing, it is always good to have an object in front of you, rather than a photograph. As my paper is light in tone, I loosely sketch in a mid-tone base layer, using Pan Pastel powder applied with a tissue. This gives me a base to draw over with darks and lights.To get a feel for the flowing curves, I use a brown Conté crayon on its edge, twisting and turning around the form. At the sweetcorn base I press hard to give weight and shadow, and higher up, as the leaves grow thinner, I reduce the pressure.One of the many joys of drawing with pastel is when you put a light over a dark. So I draw in the fine details of the corn, and sharp shadow lines with a broken shard of black Conté. I emphasise light on the leaves with a soft white Unison pastel, and cut into edges to make shapes more delicate.Holding the peacock feather as delicately as I can, I draw it with brown Conté crayon, equally as delicately, letting the strokes float off at the ends. I smudge it lightly to give a soft base for the eye.For the intense colours of the feather’s eye, I use Unison pastels and Conté Crayons. If you don’t have the right colours, you just have to go with what is in your box, mixing them on the surface. I make marks in the direction of the fronds, smudging lightly. Leaving some flecks of white showing through helps create shimmer.For the thin lines running through the eye, and for the finest ends of some of the fronds, I use a really dark Faber Castell PITT Pastel Pencil. I keep the point on pastel pencils with a sharp scalpel, which is also useful for cutting shards of pastel for details.The essence of this dried artichoke head is in the hard spiky leaves, in contrast to the soft, fluffy seeds in the centre. To get that strong feeling, I make hard, aggressive marks with Conté crayons and Unison pastels, working with speed and energy, creating strong tonal contrasts. Using soft pastels adds to the weight and solidity of the form.For the finest feeling of prickles, I use shards and sharp edges. If you drop your pastels on the floor and they break, keep those little bits! Remember, an edge is as good as a point. Pastel pencils are great for fine work, but if you find you need intense highlights, a broken soft pastel can give more exciting results.This article originally appeared in Paint & Draw: Still Life.

digital art,https://www.creativebloq.com/how-to/fix-black-screen-on-macbook-pro,Black screen on MacBook Pro? Here's how to fix it,Joseph Foley,Capture the essence of natural forms by combining these two mediums.,"A black screen on MacBook Pro is something many people dread. We consider Apple MacBooks to be among the best laptops for creatives, and the most reliable. But as with any device, sometimes something goes wrong, and when it does, it's usually at the worst time when you desperately need to get on with work.MacBook Pro black screens can occur in several forms, and the good news is that it's often not a major cause for concern. You'll normally see a black screen on MacBook Pro (or a grey or blue screen) at least once during startup, and sometimes the startup process can take longer than others, especially if it's been a while since you've used your device. This can be unnerving, but if you sit it out, the laptop might start up normally. However, If you've waited and are still seeing a MacBook Pro black screen (or MacBook Air black screen) after a few minutes, it's time to try to solve the issue. Before you start fretting about repair bills at your nearest Apple Authorised Service Provider or store, try working through the steps below. Many of our writers and creative contributors use MacBooks for their daily work, so a black screen on MacBook Pro is an issue we've come across more than a few times. These are the steps we've been through to try to solve the problem, whether it involves the laptop's own screen or an external display.Speaking of external displays, if you're looking to expand your screen space, see our choice of the best monitors for MacBook Pro or the best 4K monitors. And If you're looking to upgrade your laptop, see our pick of the best MacBook Pro deals.Whether your using an older Intel MacBook or a brand new M2 MacBook Pro, any number of issues can cause a MacBook Pro black screen, or a MacBook Air black screen for that matter. Sometimes it can happen waking your laptop from sleep, and sometimes it can be caused by broke disk permissions or a software error. Below we'll outline the steps to try if the problem is a black, or otherwise blank screen on your MacBook's own display (If your problem is with an external monitor, skip to how to fix a black screen on a MacBook Pro external monitor.This might seem obvious and you've probably already done it, but just to be sure, do check the power and brightness controls. It can be a massive relief to discover the issue is something as simple as this. If you're running on battery, connect your laptop to its charger just in case the battery has run down. Check the power indicator light shows so you can rule out a faulty power cable. It’s also possible that you (or your cat) might have unintentionally hit the brightness keys on the keyboard at some point at that you screen is simply dimmed. Hit F2 or use the control bar to try increasing the brightness on your MacBook Pro.Peripheral devices like printers, keyboards, external drives, mice and trackpads can all cause potential start up problems. If you definitely have power, but your MacBook isn't starting up, make sure it's disconnected from anything other than your charging cable and adapter.Once you've confirmed that the laptop is receiving power and you've ruled out the possibility of interference from peripheral devices, the next thing to try is a simple restart. Pressing Control + Command (the symbol with four loops) + Power/Eject/Touch ID button (depending on your model) should automatically restart your device. Alternatively, hold the power button for 5 seconds to shut down your MacBook Pro, wait 15 seconds and then press the button again to reboot. Fingers crossed.Still no luck? Then try a forced reset and then start up from macOS Recovery. Sometimes a good old-fashioned hard restart is all it takes to fix all kinds of MacBook issues. On an Apple-chipped MacBook Pro (from the M1 MacBook Pro 13 to the new 2023 M2 Pro and M2 Max models), press and hold the power button for about 10 seconds. You should see the startup options window, which includes a gear icon labelled Options. Select Options and Continue. If the options window doesn't appeal, release the power button, and press and hold it again for another 10 seconds. If the startup options window doesn't appear, release the power button and try again.On an older Intel-chipped MacBook Pro, press and hold the power button for about 10 seconds, then press and release the power button and immediately press and hold Command + R until you see an Apple logo or other image. If you still see a blank screen after about 20 seconds, it's time to move on. In both cases, if this recovers your screen, it's worth running Disk Utility to check for errors. If Disk Utility finds errors and repair them, restart your MacBook again afterwards. If it finds no errors, Apple recommends reinstalling macOS.This isn't official from Apple, but years of MacBook lore claim that a particular key sequence can sometimes revive a non-reacting blank MacBook Pro screen. Press power button once, Press 'S' (the sleep hotkey), and then hold the power button to perform a hard shut down. Wait 15 seconds and press the button to restart. We have no idea why this works, but plenty of people have vouched for it.MacBook Pro Safe Mode allows you to start you MacBook without other launch agents booting up. This can eliminate the potential for issues with other apps and services interfering and preventing your screen from displaying correctly.To boot into Safe Mode, power off and let your MacBook Pro sit for 20 seconds. Turn it on again and immediately hold down the Shift key. Release the Shift key when the login window appears. You should see 'Safe Boot' in the upper right corner of the window. Sometimes you may be asked to login twice, and your computer may take a longer than usual to start while it carries out diagnostics. After it's completely booted up, you can restart again in normal startup and see if the black screen is fixed.If that doesn't work, it's time to start turning to more technical solutions. NVRAM (non-volatile random-access memory) and PRAM (Parameter RAM) are small memory partitions that store settings like volume control and display resolution. Sometimes they encounter issues and require resetting. To do that, power down then hit the power button again to boot up you MacBook. Immediately hold down Option + Command + P + R at the same time while the machine boots, and keep holding them down until you hear the startup chime (around 2 seconds)Note that you may lose some of your settings by doing this, so if this does solve the issue, check you system preferences afterwards to make sure your date/time, display and disk options are correct.The Mac's Systems Management Controller (SMC) controls things like temperature, keyboard, display and fans. Resetting the SMC is another possible quick fix to resolve a black screen on MacBook Pro. Turn of your MacBook and unplug it for at least 15 seconds before plugging in again. Then, with the power still off, hold down Shift + Option + Control + the power button all together. Release the keys when your MacBook starts booting up.As a very last resort you may need to reinstall MacOS, but note that this will mean effectively reverting to a new Mac. You may want to contact Apple Support before resorting to this. While you can non-destructively reinstall macOS without deleting files, we recommend always backing up your files and folders to an external hard drive or to the cloud in order to be prepared for this eventuality.The steps above should help you resolve a MacBook Pro black screen, or a black screen on MacBook Air but if your laptop's own screen is working but an external monitor is blank, there are other things to try.It may seem obvious, but first check the power on your external monitor and then check you connections. Most MacBook Pros only offer Thunderbolt/USB-C connectors for external monitors, so if you're using a monitor with a different connection, you'll need to check your adapter or dock too.  If you find that the external display doesn't turn on after you connect it, try connecting your display while your MacBook is turned off, and then switch your MacBook on.The black screen on a MacBook Pro external monitor may be caused by simply closing your laptop. By default, this automatically puts your MacBook Pro to sleep. If you want to be able to close the lid of your MacBook Pro but still use the laptop via an external monitor, you'll need to change some settings. Go to System Preferences > Battery > Energy Saver > Power Adapter, and move the slider to Never. Note that you'll also need to have a keyboard and either a mouse or trackpad connected to your MacBook Pro or it will still sleep on closing the lid.If the external monitor display is still blank go to System Preferences > Displays. You can press the Alt/option key to bring up the 'Detect Displays' button. Click on 'Detect Displays', to prompt your MacBook Pro to recognise the external monitor. See our guide to how to connect a monitor to MacBook Pro for more details on using an external monitor and see our guide to the best dock for MacBook Pro to expand your connection options.In the above we've dealt with how to fix a MacBook Pro black screen when the screen is showing nothing at all. There are other issues that can occur, for example, the screen may flash a question mark, a circle with a line through it or something else. These are all signs that your MacBook it powering on but isn't starting up:A circle with a line through it: this means that your startup disk contains a Mac operating system but you're not able to use it. Apple recommends that you press and hold the power button on your Mac for up to 10 seconds until your device turns off and then use Disk Utility to repair your startup disk (see above).A folder with a flashing question mark: this means that your startup disk is no longer available or doesn't contain a working Mac operating system. Apple recommends that if the question mark is persistent and your Mac isn't starting up, again try pressing and holding the power button for up to 10 seconds until your Mac turns off and then using Disk Utility to repair your startup disk. If it doesn't find any errors, you may have no option but to reinstall macOS.Lock icon: If your Mac is using a firmware password, the lock icon will appear if you try to start up from another disk or volume, such as an external drive or macOS Recovery. You'll need to enter the firmware password to continue.Apple logo and progress bar: If the startup process stalls on the Apple logo or progress bar, press and hold the power button for up to 10 seconds until your Mac turns off, and then turn it back on. If the issue continues, turn it off again and unplug all non-essential accessories. If that doesn't work, try repairing the disk using Disk Utility or reinstalling MascOS from MacOS Recovery.If your problem is a black screen on Mac mini or Mac Studio, it can be more difficult to resolve if you don't have an alternative display that can use. First you need to identify if the problem is with the monitor or the computer. On the computer side of things, you can try many of the steps mentioned in the first part of the guide above, resetting the computer to see if that resolves the issue. But before you resort to reinstalling MacOS, it would make sense to rule out the monitor (or connection cable) as the source of the problem. An easy way to do this is to try the monitor with another device that has HDMI output, if you have one. If the monitor screen is black when connected to another device, you know the issue is with the screen or the cable.if you're able to identify the monitor as the culprit, check the brightness isn't turned down to zero (If it has a digital menu, use the navigation buttons, or you may be able to use F2), and then try unplugging it from the power and waiting 15 seconds before plugging it back in. This should work like a hard shutdown for a computer. If you don’t have another device with HDMI output to test the screen with, you could try connecting your Mac mini to another device with HDMI input, such as a TV, to check if the mini can be ruled out as the source of the problem.","your laptop, or a grey or blue screen after a few minutes, it's time to try to solve the issue.

The option to quickly use this generative AI to create a mix of images from prompts makes things easier, but you still need to know a few things to get the AI image to work as a Procreate brush. Procreate has emerged as one of the most popular and powerful applications for artists and designers (read our Procreate review for more details). One of the key features that sets Procreate apart is its extensive library of customisable brushes, allowing artists to create unique and stunning artwork. However, sometimes you may want to explore beyond the pre-existing brushes and design your own. A new fun way to explore this is with Adobe Firefly, the new generative AI. Read my feature how to use Adobe Firefly in your workflow for more on this app. In this tutorial, I will guide you through the process of creating a Procreate brush using Adobe Firefly.Below I will walk you through the steps to create a custom Procreate brush using Adobe Firefly. Adobe Firefly is a powerful and intuitive online generative art tool from Adobe that enables you to design and fine-tune your artistic prompts and ideas. Whether you're looking to create realistic textures, unique brush strokes, or specialised effects, Adobe Firefly provides the tools to bring your imagination to life.I have been developing this image of 1980s villain Webstor from the Master of The Universe. I thought to would be a good place to start playing with Adobe Firefly to create a set of spider web brushes and textures. To start I went to  the Adobe Firefly beta website to generate some images. You will need an Adobe account to sign in and then you're good to go.Next I search using terms such as ""spider web on black background"" or ""spider web in dark cave"" to create images I could use as a base to accompany the 3D render of my character I have previously created with ZBrush, Keyshot, Photoshop and Procreate. (Read our list of the best ZBrush tutorials for more details on how to start sculpting in 3D.)Once I am happy with the results I download some of the images and open them in Photoshop to prep them for the next stage. The first thing I do is use the Lasso tool and Edit > Content Aware Fill to remove the Adobe watermark. I then upscale the artwork by selecting, Image > Image Size and change the resolution to 300dpi at 4000 x 4000 pixels. I use Image > Adjustments > Threshold to create a solid black and white image to make a brush from. The next step is to make a Photoshop brush, which I can export to Procreate is by pressing select from the top bar then Select All and finally Define Brush pre-set. Your image must be under 4000 pixels in order for this to work; 2500 pixels is a good safe size too.Once I am are happy with the new brushes I can select them from the brush drop down menu and export as an .ABR file to upload to my cloud, s here I'm using Dropbox, these can then be found on my iPad later. I also save JPEGs and PNGs of the images to directly import to create brushes in Procreate as a second option.Now that I have the brushes imported to Procreate, I select the brush and double-tap it to open the options window. There are a number of options and sliders to play with and try new variants of the same brush. Unlike Photoshop you can use the right-hand side of the brush window to test your brush strokes live as you adjust it, which is a lot of fun and encourages experimentation.When I finish playing with the adjustments I test my brush on the composite image that I airdrop from my laptop. I perform a quick blend using an oil brush in Procreate. This is often part of my process now, as I have moved away from my large screen tablet connected to my laptop. Making brushes like this now means I’m using Procreate more and more in my workflow daily.Next, I also try a diffident method to create brushes from images in Procreate directly. First off, I create a blank canvas or work on an existing one. In the brush palette press the 'Plus' button in the top tight hand corner. Next go down to the Shape option. In the right hand corner of this options window press the Edit button so you can import your own image.You can use the same options as previously mentioned in order to create a new brush or texture brush from this image. Because I painted the edges black in Photoshop and the shape is not cut off at the edge it should be very easy to experiment with it to create a fun brush to use.From my experience of creating these type of brushes in Photoshop for many years before owning Procreate was released, I tend to first adjust the size, opacity, pressure, jitter and rotation of the brush, which can be found in the Dynamics tab similar to Photoshop. Keep tweaking and experimenting in Procreate's brush editor as there are some powerful tools in this app, such as materials. These options can add great subtlety to your brushes and textures. Experimenting with all these sliders will take time but familiarity will lead to faster and better workflow.","to create a set of spider web brushes and textures using Adobe Firefly.

This tutorial explains what they are and how to use them. For more tips and tricks on drawing animals, landscapes and humans, see our how to draw tutorials. And if you need to stock up your pencil case, don't miss our best pencils, best mechanical pencils and best sharpeners guides.Dividers come in many of sizes and are used to transfer a drawing 1:1 or to enlarge or reduce. There will either be a sliding scale or a series of holes with a screw or clip to join the two pieces together to form a pivot point. Decide on the scale you want and adjust accordingly. The centre hole will usually be 1:1 scale.Print a grey-scale reference to draw on and draw a frame on your paper. I’m transferring 1:1, so my frame is the same size as the original. At each key point on the reference you will draw a dot to form a sort of dot-to-dot map. Although I’ve drawn a few here, I generally draw the dots as I work to avoid confusion.Chose a starting point on the reference and draw your first dot. Place one divider point on the frame of the image and the other on the point you drew to take the measure. Move the dividers to the drawing page and draw a vertical line. Repeat from the top of the image, and where the lines cross, mark your dot. Join up to create the outline.Continue working around your image in this way until you have an outline of dots. Add as many or as few dots as necessary and join them up, paying particular attention to your reference. Soon you will have an outline sketch that you can refine into a full drawing. As your drawing confidence increases, you may find you need fewer dots.This article originally appeared in Paint & Draw: Animals. Buy the Paint & Draw: Animals bookazine.",to draw a point. Repeat from the top of the image and mark your dot. Add as many dots as necessary and join them up to create the outline. This tutorial explains what proportional dividers are and how to use them.
