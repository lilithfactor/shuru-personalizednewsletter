creative inspiration,https://www.creativereview.co.uk/pilo-branding/,"Youth hostel Pilo gets a fun, fluffy visual identity",2023-06-22,"Designed by 5.5, the branding embodies the youthful energy and quality experience at the heart of the Lyon hostel, including a custom font inspired by pillows",Daniel Milroy Maher,"Pilo, a new generation youth hostel in Lyon, France, enlisted the help of Paris-based design studio 5.5 to create a brand identity that matches its vision.Set in a former 19th century college on the slopes of the Croix-Rousse, Pilo offers visitors space to work, socialise, eat and sleep, but does so in a way that’s unusual for a youth hostel. Pilo’s unique selling point is that, despite catering to a young demographic looking for a quick place to rest their heads, it comes in the form of a luxury hotel.It offers both comfort and convenience, mixing the energy and sleeping styles of a hostel with the elegant touches of boutique accommodation, including lavish amenities and high-quality beds and bedding.This unusual merging of typically disparate worlds was the main source of inspiration for the team at 5.5, who designed an identity that lies at the intersection between the two.“We worked with all the elements which evoke comfort in a good hotel: good beds, soft sheets, fluffy pillows, bathrobe fabrics, hotel slippers,” says 5.5 co-founder and partner, Vincent Baranger. “We designed fluffy typography inspired by folding bolster pillows, we sewed a slipper on a t-shirt, wrote messages on sheets, and we made embroidered badges to indicate the rooms.”At the heart of the identity is a custom typeface, also named Pilo, which features rounded letterforms reminiscent of folded bolster pillows – an enduring icon of youth hostels around the world. These letters feature added pleats in the corners, to further emphasise the bold and fluffy feeling.Elsewhere, signage around the hotel reflects this theme of simple luxury, with illustrations for the toilets, shower, laundry and do not disturb sign, to name but a few, rendered using playful colours, pillow and slipper imagery, and more rounded letters.Crucially, because 5.5 was formerly a product design studio, the team were conscious of how these elements of the branding could come to life physically, carefully choosing the right materials and techniques. “For Pilo, we worked with embroidery techniques to create the signage,” explains Baranger. “We used the ‘chenille’ patch technique to create room numbers that are very soft and which everybody touches before entering their room.”These thoughtful details even carry through to the staff uniform, which features a t-shirt with an actual slipper sewn onto the chest, and the menu in the restaurant, which is attached to a plastic border in the shape of a cloud and made from recycled materials.In every aspect of the Pilo visual identity, there is a whimsicality that embodies the carefree energy that youth hostels are so well known for, offset against touches of luxury that elevate the entire experience. “In short, we used the hotel as a playground,” says Baranger. “The feeling we wanted to create is very simple: at Pilo, it’s possible to have a comfortable stay and fun times at the same time.”5-5.paris","Pilo, a new generation youth hostel in Lyon, France, enlisted the help of design studio 5.5 to create a brand identity that matches its vision.

creative insight,https://www.creativereview.co.uk/onothing-beats-a-londoner-advertising/,"Ok advertising, it’s time to let go of Nothing Beats a Londoner",2023-06-20,"Nike’s 2018 campaign is still lauded for its razor-sharp representation of Black British culture. But brands who continue to piggyback of its success are missing an opportunity to genuinely connect with communities, says Damola Oladapo",Damola Oladapo,"As a Black man working in the ad world, I spend a fair amount of time discussing the foibles of being Black in advertising. What needs fixing? What’s changing? And, most importantly, what recent work represents actual progress? I recently had a thought on my mind that spoke to all three of those questions: Why is every ad from any brand that wants to hero diversity and develop cultural adjacency to Black Britishness have the same aesthetic as Nothing Beats a Londoner?In 2018, Nothing Beats a Londoner was an instant hit that immediately shook up culture, and for good reason. It was (and still is) a great distillation of London’s spirit and energy. An incredible achievement from Nike, Wieden + Kennedy, On Road and Megaforce. The ensemble cast featured some of the best and the burgeoning voices of Black British talent – Skepta, Giggs, J Hus, Jorja Smith, Michael Dappah, Little Simz, Dave, the list goes on. Even Gareth Southgate got a spot.The excellently rendered soundtrack started with Skepta’s then still relatively new-but-insta classic Shutdown, into OG bangers with Kano’s Typical Me, before Dizzee Rascal closed things out. It featured young, Black, inner-city kids speaking naturally, as they would with friends. We can credit the ad’s courage to embrace this wholeheartedly as a key moment in how the industry began its attempts to authentically represent the Black British experience.By now, most brands have all had a crack at making their version, and the clones have only helped to prop up the brilliance of the originalThe ad felt fresh, it felt new, and it felt celebratory. Celebratory because it was an acceptance and recognition that Black British culture and London’s youth are the creative engines behind the world’s premier creative hub. 2018 also saw Skepta and A$AP Rocky’s Praise Da Lord become the biggest song of the year, a symbolic passing of the zeitgeist’s torch from NYC to LDN. Virgil Abloh and Off-White took over the capital to release the designer’s legendary The Ten’ remix of Nike classics. Then there was the emergence of England’s incredible new crop of young players at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, many of which were Londoners. You couldn’t see past London as the place, and Nike’s ad was the cherry on the cake.Now, looking back, Nothing Beats a Londoner feels like the unofficial, first part of Nike’s collaboration with Corteiz. Like the first chip falling to make that collaboration feel natural. As with all great works, the ad has spawned clones. Many, many, many of them. By now, most brands have all had a crack at making their version, and the clones have only helped to prop up the brilliance of the original.But the high proliferation of this style has also made it feel a bit reductive. Five years ago, the use of aesthetic-as-narrative felt like a real shift. The whip pans. The mixed perspectives. The crash zooms. The frenetic, kinetic cutting. A comic book panel in motion. The visual verbiage felt like a real understanding of how to create work that authentically represented the big, bright, and charismatically unique energy of Black British London.Five years on, the same aesthetic-as-narrative device has begun to feel platitudinal. A bit like having token Black/brown people in the frame to hint at comfort with diversity, rather than engaging with the layers of their experience to tell stories from. The culture has evolved, and the consumers have matured. It’s time for some fresh, new takes on storytelling in advertising if brands want to keep attracting and convert new black and brown customers. For example, Ikea’s recent ad under the Wonderful Everyday platform from Mother is a good example of fusing said aesthetic with some very subtle, but well-considered world-building.Film has always led the way with the macro cultural beats, then advertising follows. Take Raine Allen Miller’s debut feature Rye Lane, a Black British romcom featuring two African twenty-somethings from Peckham. It has loads of stylistic flair, it’s funny, acerbic and cleverly written, it has substance and style. Of course, a two-hour feature is going to give you more story than a two-minute ad. But Rye Lane represents progress, because it begins to widen the aperture of the lived experience within Black British media and storytelling beyond the well-worn tropes of road life depictions as the only Black British films that get commissioned.Advertising in a cultural context needs to follow suit, moving on from just cool aesthetics to also building stories around some funny, honest, irreverent, cultural insights. Let’s have more than just the Black presence, a few witty zingers, some whip pans, and crash zooms, and drill-inspired sound design. We need the swagger and the layered stories too.Brands, advertisers, agencies need to start playing bigger and braver, embracing and highlighting the wealth of stories and insights from within these culturesProgress is not a linear thing. Especially when progress is contingent on defeating structural blockers within an inherently biased industry. Nothing Beats a Londoner was a moment of progress, and the huge adoption of its style by brands and advertisers is obvious proof of that. It solved a problem for brands at the time, giving them a shorthand opportunity to communicate and leverage culture effectively to shift product (and gain some cultural brownie points).But now… times up. The idea is knackered. It’s just finished running its 30th consecutive London Marathon in a pair of Air Force 1s. Brands, advertisers, agencies need to start playing bigger and braver, embracing and highlighting the wealth of stories and insights from within these cultures. If advertising still wants to leverage culture and target Black and brown consumers, it’s time to start doing it with more cleverness and ingenuity.Damola Oladapo is a London-based freelance creative director, copywriter, journalist and founder of new creative studio House Captain. He has worked with brands including Nike, Spotify, FIFA, Campari Group and Gorillas.

The first change is a revised name, with the service now officially known as LeShuttle. Following that, the brand has worked with consultancy Landor & Fitch to update its logo and a full identity system.   The rebrand was driven by data which flagged the confusion the public have around the Channel Tunnel passenger and car services. Combined with growing competition from other modes of transport, there was a need for LeShuttle to “shift perceptions to engage new audiences” and transform the brand to be seen as relevant and as an alternative low-carbon form of travel. Landor & Fitch worked with the LeShuttle team for ten months on the redesign which has been informed by consumer insights. With the goal to evoke feelings of freedom and ease when travelling, the team wanted to showcase the simplicity offered by LeShuttle, as well as create something a little more futuristic.The shortened name was pitched to separate the infrastructure from the service and give the whole brand a more contemporary feel. The updated logomark follows suit and aims to visually represent what sets LeShuttle apart: “speed, efficiency and care”. The rest of the identity hopes to differentiate itself from traditional train services in terms of its fast pace. The colour palette has also shifted away from its previous nationalistic identity to black and white with splashes of purple. For imagery, the photography opts for a user-generated look to give the sense that everyone’s journey is different and that’s the joy in the travelling experience. As the Channel Tunnel approaches its 30th anniversary next year, the brand says it is at a defining time in its history. The redesign will be implemented throughout LeShuttle’s brand and is part of a strategy to completely rethink the Channel Tunnel experience over the next decade.landorandfitch.com",to evoke feelings of freedom and ease when travelling.

The suite of fruit symbols seen throughout the visual identity are complemented by Lucas Wakamatsu’s joyful illustrations, which work particularly well when animated.“We were really inspired by the idea of bringing playfulness to consumers of all ages when we started to ideate around how to bring the brand’s purpose to the masses,” said JKR’s global ECD, Lisa Smith.“By thinking what this meant for the brand’s expression, attitude, and actions, we were able to build a distinctive brand identity that signalled Fanta’s commitment to fun at every level – from real life to digital.”jkrglobal.com",the brand’s commitment to fun at every level – from real life to digital. the brand has joined the legions of soft drinks brands unveiling a new look as of late. the new identity and packaging design were led by the Coca-Cola Global Design team.

creative insight,https://www.creativereview.co.uk/onothing-beats-a-londoner-advertising/,"Ok advertising, it’s time to let go of Nothing Beats a Londoner",2023-06-20,"Nike’s 2018 campaign is still lauded for its razor-sharp representation of Black British culture. But brands who continue to piggyback of its success are missing an opportunity to genuinely connect with communities, says Damola Oladapo",Damola Oladapo,"As a Black man working in the ad world, I spend a fair amount of time discussing the foibles of being Black in advertising. What needs fixing? What’s changing? And, most importantly, what recent work represents actual progress? I recently had a thought on my mind that spoke to all three of those questions: Why is every ad from any brand that wants to hero diversity and develop cultural adjacency to Black Britishness have the same aesthetic as Nothing Beats a Londoner?In 2018, Nothing Beats a Londoner was an instant hit that immediately shook up culture, and for good reason. It was (and still is) a great distillation of London’s spirit and energy. An incredible achievement from Nike, Wieden + Kennedy, On Road and Megaforce. The ensemble cast featured some of the best and the burgeoning voices of Black British talent – Skepta, Giggs, J Hus, Jorja Smith, Michael Dappah, Little Simz, Dave, the list goes on. Even Gareth Southgate got a spot.The excellently rendered soundtrack started with Skepta’s then still relatively new-but-insta classic Shutdown, into OG bangers with Kano’s Typical Me, before Dizzee Rascal closed things out. It featured young, Black, inner-city kids speaking naturally, as they would with friends. We can credit the ad’s courage to embrace this wholeheartedly as a key moment in how the industry began its attempts to authentically represent the Black British experience.By now, most brands have all had a crack at making their version, and the clones have only helped to prop up the brilliance of the originalThe ad felt fresh, it felt new, and it felt celebratory. Celebratory because it was an acceptance and recognition that Black British culture and London’s youth are the creative engines behind the world’s premier creative hub. 2018 also saw Skepta and A$AP Rocky’s Praise Da Lord become the biggest song of the year, a symbolic passing of the zeitgeist’s torch from NYC to LDN. Virgil Abloh and Off-White took over the capital to release the designer’s legendary The Ten’ remix of Nike classics. Then there was the emergence of England’s incredible new crop of young players at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, many of which were Londoners. You couldn’t see past London as the place, and Nike’s ad was the cherry on the cake.Now, looking back, Nothing Beats a Londoner feels like the unofficial, first part of Nike’s collaboration with Corteiz. Like the first chip falling to make that collaboration feel natural. As with all great works, the ad has spawned clones. Many, many, many of them. By now, most brands have all had a crack at making their version, and the clones have only helped to prop up the brilliance of the original.But the high proliferation of this style has also made it feel a bit reductive. Five years ago, the use of aesthetic-as-narrative felt like a real shift. The whip pans. The mixed perspectives. The crash zooms. The frenetic, kinetic cutting. A comic book panel in motion. The visual verbiage felt like a real understanding of how to create work that authentically represented the big, bright, and charismatically unique energy of Black British London.Five years on, the same aesthetic-as-narrative device has begun to feel platitudinal. A bit like having token Black/brown people in the frame to hint at comfort with diversity, rather than engaging with the layers of their experience to tell stories from. The culture has evolved, and the consumers have matured. It’s time for some fresh, new takes on storytelling in advertising if brands want to keep attracting and convert new black and brown customers. For example, Ikea’s recent ad under the Wonderful Everyday platform from Mother is a good example of fusing said aesthetic with some very subtle, but well-considered world-building.Film has always led the way with the macro cultural beats, then advertising follows. Take Raine Allen Miller’s debut feature Rye Lane, a Black British romcom featuring two African twenty-somethings from Peckham. It has loads of stylistic flair, it’s funny, acerbic and cleverly written, it has substance and style. Of course, a two-hour feature is going to give you more story than a two-minute ad. But Rye Lane represents progress, because it begins to widen the aperture of the lived experience within Black British media and storytelling beyond the well-worn tropes of road life depictions as the only Black British films that get commissioned.Advertising in a cultural context needs to follow suit, moving on from just cool aesthetics to also building stories around some funny, honest, irreverent, cultural insights. Let’s have more than just the Black presence, a few witty zingers, some whip pans, and crash zooms, and drill-inspired sound design. We need the swagger and the layered stories too.Brands, advertisers, agencies need to start playing bigger and braver, embracing and highlighting the wealth of stories and insights from within these culturesProgress is not a linear thing. Especially when progress is contingent on defeating structural blockers within an inherently biased industry. Nothing Beats a Londoner was a moment of progress, and the huge adoption of its style by brands and advertisers is obvious proof of that. It solved a problem for brands at the time, giving them a shorthand opportunity to communicate and leverage culture effectively to shift product (and gain some cultural brownie points).But now… times up. The idea is knackered. It’s just finished running its 30th consecutive London Marathon in a pair of Air Force 1s. Brands, advertisers, agencies need to start playing bigger and braver, embracing and highlighting the wealth of stories and insights from within these cultures. If advertising still wants to leverage culture and target Black and brown consumers, it’s time to start doing it with more cleverness and ingenuity.Damola Oladapo is a London-based freelance creative director, copywriter, journalist and founder of new creative studio House Captain.

With it comes a suite of additional imagery by renowned Magnum photographer David Hurn, who was invited to take pictures on the set of the final episode, Demon ’79.Directed by Toby Haynes, the episode follows a shop assistant in the north of England who discovers a mysterious talisman. From there it spirals into a “darkly comic, bizarre kind of fable”, according to Brooker, who explained in a statement that “typically, Black Mirror has focused on tech dystopias or media satire, whereas this story has a stronger supernatural element, harking back to 1970s horror.”Hurn was invited by Netflix to shoot on the set of the new season. “My brief was basically to produce 70s looking pictures,” he tells Creative Review. “As this episode was set in the 70s, I got to shoot in black and white – the 70s colour – this was easy.” Hurn has been photographing since the mid-1950s, and his direct experience of making work during the period in which the episode is set lends an authenticity to the work, rather than feeling like a pastiche.His images zero in on the episode’s main cast: theatre performer and I May Destroy You actor Paapa Essiedu in full 70s glam, alongside A Streetcar Named Desire star Anjana Vasan, dressed more demurely in her character’s shop assistant uniform. These are joined by a handful of environment shots showcasing some more of the period set design and costumes. The photos were created for Netflix’s editorial platform Queue, and will be available for use on Netflix channels worldwide.Hurn has worked on sets before, capturing everyone from Bond to the Beatles, “so the thought of re-working in this field after 30 or 40 years was pleasing rather than daunting,” he explains.Of course, in that time, TV productions have become increasingly ambitious. “I was surprised by the amount of people – so many clipboards – at least as many as a major film set of earlier times. What was most obvious for me was how equipment had advanced and was so much smaller,” he says.“I think the producer and director had faith in me and just let me get on with it. My day was very relaxed and comfortable, I simply wandered around making sure I didn’t bump into anything or end up in shot – I feel I made mini friends with a couple of very capable actors and a writer. So pictures were easy.”Black Mirror season 6 is out now on Netflix",",,,, and how equipment was used to produce the set of the new season.

It features searing new lyrics by rapper Avelino, vocals from the House Gospel Choir, and instrumentation from jazz talent development organisation Tomorrow’s Warriors.The accompanying short film takes a stark look at the state of the world and all our roles in it. Exec-produced by Steve McQueen, it has been directed by his protege Samona Olanipekun through the director’s production company Lammas Park.Envisaged as a metaphor for our current climate crisis, the film shows an increasingly raucous party where the revellers (including a cameo appearance from Will Poulter) fail to see the damage they are causing. “This short film is an arresting look at the state of a world hurtling out of control,” says McQueen.“It captures the unease at seeing corporations (especially those of oil and gas) and their enablers do damage to the environment on our behalf, acting like there’s no tomorrow and driving the climate crisis solely for their profit. But we have collective power to realise a different future. It’s imperative that people don’t forget, tomorrow is promised to no one.”Don’t Stop will feature heavily at Glastonbury this year, with the film airing on the big screens at main stages throughout the festival.

creative inspiration,https://www.creativereview.co.uk/sowvital-branding/,Nature and cosmetics inspire Sowvital’s branding,2023-06-15,"Drawing on lifestyle aesthetics and plant motifs, Sowvital’s new identity is both aspirational and down-to-earth",Daniel Milroy Maher,"Design studio LDS has collaborated with plant sciences brand Sowvital to create its new identity. Founded in London in 2022, Sowvital is a plant care brand offering vegan and environmentally friendly products.To create the branding, the team drew heavily on the cosmetics industry as a source of design inspiration, taking cues for everything from its product shape and packaging to its colour palette and product photography. LDS founder Leslie David says that the branding and packaging are based on the idea of “mirroring the rituals and behaviours from the beauty and wellness space”.Although Sowvital’s current core offerings are indoor and lifestyle-oriented, its plans to expand to more outdoor, technical products in the future meant that the LDS team developed a versatile and adaptable identity – one rooted in the duality of “heritage and innovation”.Much like other aspects of the branding, the Sowvital logo references forms found in nature, but offers a modern twist. “We developed a brand symbol that reinterprets early botanical drawings, often cross-sections, showing the innards of a leaf in a very schematic way,” explains David. It was about “taking inspiration from a broad archive of horticultural art, bringing the core foundations of the botanical world into the present day, and creating a contemporary interpretation of the science that backs up the formulations that Sowvital creates”.Despite the academic nature of the inspiration, these visual elements feel far from rigid and formulaic. The abstract, artistic rendering of the logo combines with other playful illustrations found elsewhere across the brand, including anthropomorphic drawings of plants that add a joyful and friendly touch to Sowvital’s communications.Speaking on the former, David says “these mysterious shapes came together quite fast, likened to a Rorschach test, and highlight the ambiguity of flowers, and forms found within nature as a whole”. She goes on: “It’s our hope this reignites the innate awe and appreciation we all have for the natural world, which urban living doesn’t always allow us to feel so connected to.”These evocative and eye-catching illustrations are complemented by a minimal colour palette that juxtaposes off-white labels and packaging with punchier gradients, again referencing the cosmetic industry in its slickness, but offsetting that against earthier elements that speak to Sowvital’s ethos.As a B Corp, creating a sustainability-focused identity was a crucial part of the process, and David says this commitment informed her studio’s approach. “They take great care not only in the processes used in their formulations but also in their packaging and fulfilment. By focusing on recyclable, carbon-neutral materials, the packaging aims to maintain its elegance and quality to reflect the product within, while still being considerate of the world it occupies.”leslie-david.com","and design studio LDS has collaborated with plant sciences brand Sowvital to create its new identity.

creative inspiration,https://www.creativereview.co.uk/channel-4-idents/,Channel 4’s cascading idents reflect Britain’s multitudes,2023-06-14,"The broadcaster has revealed a new set of looping channel idents envisioned by 17 different creators, with each scene connected by the 4 logo",Megan Williams,"Channel 4 has unveiled a new set of idents made by its in-house creative division, 4creative, in collaboration with Art Practice and Love Song. The five idents consist of five unique scenes joined together into cascading sequences based on a theme: Identity, Land, System, Release, and Love.“This allows for variety through the day as our idents play out all day, every day – so creating different start points was important not just from a creative variety point of view but also making them fit for purpose as continually repeated assets,” 4creative ECD Lynsey Atkin tells us.The base of the 4 logo, which has been foregrounded in Channel 4’s new brand identity, acts as a cube-shaped portal into the next scene. “It means contrasting worlds sit unquestionably next to each other,” Atkin says. “Much like Channel 4 itself, you never quite know what’s around the next corner and hopefully that keeps things interesting!” The scenes are truly broad: from warehouse to woodland, schoolyard to graveyard, and even an underwater seascape.Mike Skrgatic, creative director at Art Practice, describes it as “one long, ever-changing tapestry” that reflects modern Britain, fitting with Channel 4’s new Altogether Different brand line. Yet the smooth segue from scene to scene also appears to tie in with the broadcaster’s ambitions to blend its linear and digital presence, which includes bringing its on-demand service All 4 under the Channel 4 banner.The scenes were created by 17 different directors and creators working across a mix of live action, animation, and computer generated imagery. Creating seamless transitions between them required extensive planning, from balancing scales, orientations, textures, tones, and palettes, to calculating the variable speed of the camera’s movement through each scene.“The camera moves 25 times faster at the head of the move compared to when we arrive at the base of the 4 and enter into the incoming scene. The motion resets and the incoming scene takes over, travelling 25 times faster,” explains Skrgatic. “This factor alone took golden spiral, Mandelbrot-like, complex mathematical consideration to solve. I love where art meets science, this felt like a collision of those worlds.”The ambitious concept was bound to throw up challenges – and, with it being all about Britain, that obviously involved the weather. Skrgatic says the team was “riding our luck with the weather in Scotland”, where all of the live action scenes were shot across four days. Atkin recalls the Friday night scene, which appears to be suspended in time, being particularly difficult. The shoot took place on a windy night, which caused concerns as “we needed not just our cast, but their hair, props and clothing to stay absolutely, completely still in order to achieve the effect”.The emphasis on craft is clear to see in every kind of visual, whether that’s “syncing panes of shattering glass captured in high speed”, Skrgatic says, or the extensive post and VFX work led by Time Based Arts.To mark the launch, there will be a one-off screening of a version that uses all 25 scenes as an ad break takeover. The continuous version is linked together with the help of spoken word artist John Joseph Holt, whose affectionate narration of the “pot-holed United Kingdom” manages to encapsulate Channel 4’s critical yet warm spirit.The visuals were near completion when Holt was brought in. “It meant the writer could personally respond to the work, rather than us be overly prescriptive,” Atkin explains.“Like everything through the project, we wanted to feel the artist’s intention, rather than the heavy hand of an all-seeing eye. I hope this is ultimately what the work achieves – a seamless group of worlds that all work together, but showcase very different voices and styles,” she says, “an infinite looping universe where nothing stands out because everything stands out.”Credits:Agency: 4creativeECD: Lynsey AtkinCreative Directors: Mike Srgatic, Daniel Wolfe, Lynsey Atkin, BaficProduction Company: Art Practice x Love SongDoPs: Daniel Landin, Eponine MomenceauVFX and Post Production: Time Based ArtsAudio Post Production: String and TinsDirectors: Saman Aminzadeh, Optical Arts, Bafic, Mike Battcock, Will Dohrn, Daniel Eatock, Mike Skrgatic and James Allen, Verity May Lane, Maria Lax, Tim McCourt and Max Taylor (The Line), Louis McCourt, Justyna Obasi, Elliott Power, The Romantix, Dan Tobin Smith (Optical Arts), Daniel WolfeSpoken word: John Joseph Holt","a new set of idents created by its in-house creative division, 4creative. the five idents consist of five unique scenes joined together into cascading sequences based on a theme: Identity, Land, System, Release, and Love. the five idents consist of five unique scenes joined together into cascading sequences based on a theme: Identity, Land, System, Release, and Love."

I often find inspiration for how a space can work through the things that already exist in it and how it feels to be physically present there, as well as visualising how I can adapt it through propping and styling to align with the personality of the brand I am working with.”“I go off decor, vibe and colours, and how they match either the fashion or product we are shooting,” says Andy Hoang, an editorial and commercial photographer represented by Studio PI. “I prefer a location with a distinctive personality that you don’t have to add much to,” he continues. “I’m more about shooting the environment, unless it’s a studio-based shoot where we’d recruit a set designer to add props and backdrops.”Hoang gives the example of a recent shoot for a sunglasses brand: “One of the requirements was to have a retro 80s bathroom. You can’t hire that in,” he smiles. “In situations like that, a location house that ticks the box is always more ideal – and cheaper – than creating a whole set-build to fulfil the required criteria.”MIX THINGS UPIf a location is already decorated in a distinctive way, chances are you will have chosen it because it fits the brief at hand. But that doesn’t mean bringing additional props and rearranging furniture is off the cards.“Each shoot is completely different,” explains Bateman. “Generally, there will be some space reconfiguration required: sometimes for the visual aesthetic, other times from a practical perspective. Remove any subjectivity from your personal taste in interior design and approach the art direction through the lens of the campaign you are working on.”“Hosts understand the multitude of ways their space will be used, so most understand that furniture or props may need to be moved,” adds Liz Yam, design principal at New York-based agency Keithcity Group, who regularly books spaces using Peerspace. “Once, we were in a home with a type of flooring that would scuff if tape was applied to it,” she continues. “So, we took lots of ‘before’ photos to reference where to put things back.”“We just ask guests to move furniture back to how they found it,” says Karen Rosalie, founder of Rosalie Agency, who has three different shoot spaces available to hire on Peerspace. “More often than not, you’re booking a location for what the space offers – so moving things around should be minimal.”“I prefer minimal rearranging,” agrees Hoang. “I may hire in small bits of furniture to add depth, but nothing over the top. I’d normally go with the flow of how the set is already laid out, as that’s the main reason for hiring the space,” he points out. “For me, the only changes would usually be to remove small intruding items that distract from the main focus.”EXPLORE EVERY ANGLE“People are surprised how much they can get from one location, however small it may be,” continues Hoang. “In one small room, you could shoot wide-angle to change perspective, add props to give it another element, or even add creative light setups to change the mood of the scene. If, in a bare white studio, you can shoot a whole editorial by the same rules, you can definitely achieve more on a location which already has character.”Thorough pre-production is always vital for any shoot to run smoothly. “Locking in the shot-list and defining a clear approach to art direction is key,” advises Bateman. “Doing a test shoot to explore all of the compositions within the approved shot list is also essential.”Sometimes things don’t go entirely to plan, of course: Bateman gives a real-life example of a week-long shoot where a tree had come into full bloom since the initial location scouting, and it was blocking the natural light coming into the space.In cases like this, thinking on your feet can help make the most of the time you have, rather than spending it firefighting. “I try to allow room for a bit of spontaneity and ‘happy mistakes’ – those extra shots that you didn’t plan for, but are inspired to create on location,” adds Bateman. “These can be the most exciting ones to shoot, and quite often end up making the final cut.”TICK MULTIPLE BOXESCapturing multiple pieces of content during one shoot helps maximise efficiency of both time and budget. “We ask talent to bring a change of clothes, and then we utilise another room,” explains Yam. “If you need to do the same, I recommend booking locations with multiple rooms.”Hoang recalls a shoot featuring luxury handbags and shoes that required a mixture of exterior shots on London streets and interior shots with a model. For the latter, he secured the use of the Presidential Suite at a boutique Kensington hotel. “We used it for our lifestyle shots, but also as a base for changes and our central point to a few outdoor location spots nearby,” he explains. “Having a base of operations makes life so much easier.”“Being able to see as much of a location as possible before actually visiting it – such as different angles and ways it’s been styled and used previously – can help you envisage how the space could work for your brief,” advises Bateman.“Finding the right location is just part of the challenge,” he concludes. “How you bring the client along on the journey with you is another. Think about how to express your creative vision for the space through visual references, like mood boards for props and styling, so they get a clear understanding of how the final space will look and feel. Get them excited about it. And make sure you allow enough time for alignment and approval.”Get 15% off your next location booking at peerspace.com",", but with the right location and enough creative vision, you can make Berkshire look like Brazil.“Finding the right location for a location shoot is an art in itself,” says creative director at Vault49. “No location is ever going to be 100% perfect, so you need a bit of imagination to see its potential,” says Jonny Bateman. “I prefer a location with a distinctive personality that you don’t have to add much to,” says Hoang. “I’m more about shooting the"

Consensus is growing that design deserves a seat at the top table of global business as we shape how the brands of the future look and behave.In a blog post explaining his choice to invest in collaborative interface design tool Figma, Peter Levine dubbed the 2020s ‘The Decade of Design’. He sees a radical shift in the role of design in organisations of all sizes, especially for digital interactions. “Products and companies will live or die by their product design and design literacy,” he wrote.“Design is fundamental to this,” declares Mauro Porcini, chief design officer at PepsiCo. “It’s about understanding people, and how they interact with platforms in unexpected ways. We’re makers and doers, and companies need designers in-house to build that culture.”People don’t have the patience they used to with digital products that are difficult to use“The companies that are leading these changes are the ones that have invested in design,” points out Ash Snook, head of product design and UX research at Vodafone Product & Services. “YouTube, Airbnb, Netflix, Uber – they all disrupted industries beyond imagination and consequently changed the way we now live. And yet, most applications and websites still don’t offer an adequate user experience.”“People don’t have the patience they used to with digital products that are difficult to use,” agrees Noah Levin, senior director of product design at Figma. “They don’t want to, simply because they don’t need to anymore. It’s easier than ever to start a company these days, so design then becomes the differentiating factor for success.”DESIGN’S INFLUENCE IS GROWING AT THE HIGHEST LEVELHaving been chief design officer at PepsiCo for over a decade, Porcini is at the forefront of a growing trend for global companies across a broad range of sectors to appoint executive-level design leaders: he has counterparts at Nike, Salesforce, YouTube, and Barclays, to name just a few.“20 years ago, those few companies with design at the top were in sectors where aesthetic was a competitive advantage: fashion, furniture, automotive, and more recently consumer electronics,” says Porcini. “Now, wherever I turn there is a new position – in every kind of industry. As designers, we must make sure we play the role they expect us to play.”They might recognise the need to transform their practices, but you can’t just bring in one person. You need a cultural shiftThe idea that senior design leaders can transform the fortunes of brands is gaining traction, but Levin believes there’s more to be done to get the balance right. “Not many companies know what to do with those roles yet,” he says. “They might recognise the need to transform their practices, but you can’t just bring in one person. You need a cultural shift.”DESIGN EXCELLENCE IS A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGEWith globalisation and new technology slashing manufacturing costs – and digital channels levelling the playing field for sales and marketing – once insurmountable barriers to entry are falling across every sector.“It’s the age of the start-up,” says Porcini. “In the past, big companies could protect their products and brands even if they were mediocre, and not fulfilling people’s needs and wants. Not anymore. If you’re weak, even in one area, that’s where newcomers will enter.”Faced with an army of challengers, design is once again the answer. “Big companies and small companies alike are left with one solution: focus on people,” he continues. “This is what designers do. We are obsessed with creating extraordinary quality for people. Either you create excellence, or someone else will do it on your behalf.”To build a house you need an engineer. But to build a beautiful house, you need an architectIn the past, a decent digital platform could set a brand apart. Now, decent simply isn’t enough. “The more the competitive landscape levels, the more you have to play on the nuances of how good that experience is,” explains Porcini, noting that user friendliness and emotional engagement are increasingly vital factors for any brand to consider.“To build a house you need an engineer. But to build a beautiful house, you need an architect,” he says. “It’s so obvious that you need the same thing in the digital world, but the digital world may not realise it yet.”DESIGN THINKING GETS THINGS DONE FASTER – AND BETTERAccording to Margaret Cyphers, UX director at Google, design and innovation are too often the first to be cut in a crisis. “In my opinion, it’s the most powerful way to drive change,” she argues. “Does your product feel stale? Are you falling behind the competition? Seeing user frustration or abandonment? It’s likely you’re undervaluing the power of design thinking.”A decade ago, companies would spend months on strategic planning before releasing any kind of digital product to the public. “It’s now possible to prototype in a day or a week what would have taken a year before. You’re learning 10 times faster,” says Levin.There’s no shortage of people in a company with ideas, but design takes those ideas and makes them real“It’s a humbling moment when you realise you have to try stuff, iterate, and study what’s really going on in the world,” Levin continues. “Even the smartest person can still be wrong about what customers need. There’s no shortage of people in a company with ideas, but design takes those ideas and makes them real. And it does it faster.”DESIGN IS MOST POWERFUL WHEN TRULY COLLABORATIVEDesign and engineering used to be much more siloed disciplines, until collaborative tools such as Figma helped facilitate two-way communication at every stage of the process. “In the past, designers would do a big Steve Jobs-style reveal, and developers would reply, ‘What the heck? That’s not even feasible’,” smiles Levin. “That kind of working is hopefully going away. Developers should be involved early in the design process so they not only feel more invested in it, but also have the chance to make it better.”A Forrester Consulting study, commissioned by Figma, found efficiency gains when stakeholders get involved in the design process earlier. Late-stage changes from executives are less likely, and developers can do their jobs better. “If they’re going to spend two weeks implementing a feature, they want to know why it’s good; why it’s helpful,” reasons Levin. “Figma can help a lot here, as everyone can be in the same place just by sharing a link.”Statistics suggest that, as well as within executive positions, designers are getting more seats at the table within the teams at the coalface of digital product creation: according to a recent survey by Nielsen Norman Group, many companies reported a 1:10 designer-to-developer ratio in 2020, a dramatic shift from 1:20 in 2017.We need to include design in early planning, prioritisation, and strategy,But while such ratios are important, Cyphers points how that how you work is even more vital. “We need to include design in early planning, prioritisation, and strategy,” she says. “If your ratios feel appropriate, but the outcomes are still lacking, look at your cross-functional processes. Is design being treated as a service or a partnership?”For Snook, there’s a sweet spot to be found. “Increasing the number of designers to a certain extent adds value, but too many and you’ll slow everything down,” he argues. “I’d recommend curating a small group of very talented designers, and a larger group of developers to translate ideas into functioning products that scale.”DESIGN CULTURE BENEFITS EVERYONEDriven by the hallowed profile of individuals like Jony Ive, some may dismiss executive-level design influence as a passing management fad. While C-Suite design leaders are on the rise, many face pressure to prove progress or risk losing influence.The problem with measuring design by conventional ROI methods, argues Porcini, is that its impact isn’t restricted to a single product or campaign. “If Apple had released the iPhone and all their other products, packaging, and experiences were mediocre, it wouldn’t have got the same result,” he suggests. “The secret lies in creating a full ecosystem of extraordinary experiences across every touchpoint. Before you can deliver that value, you need a few years to invest in the brand.”Understand your customers, and from there, hire designers“It’s up to design leaders to help deliver value, but also for a company to build good design into its core,” agrees Cyphers. “The best way to demonstrate the value of design is to keep delivering work that resonates with users and inspires them to share it with others.”“It’s easy to find someone who’ll tell you what you want to hear,” Levin points out. “It’s harder to find someone who’s truly using your product, making that purchasing decision, and will tell you what you don’t want to hear.”“Understand your customers, and from there, hire designers,” he concludes. “Pay them well, they’ll hopefully change your business. Sales and marketing won’t solve a bad product. You need to make good ones, and for that you need designers.”Image via Shutterstock; Discover how companies like yours are redesigning how they design at figma.com.","is growing that design deserves a seat at the top table of global business.

There’s a TikTok language beyond trends, and that’s the crux of it. Brands that define a creative POV are the ones that succeed.”“TikTok allows brands to really let their personality shine through, engaging with their audience and putting their own spin on of-the-minute trends and topics,” agrees Anna Cardiff, digital lead at Coty UK, responsible for Rimmel London’s TikTok channel – which has over 55,000 followers.“It’s about continuously monitoring, exploring, and evolving,” she continues. “What people want to see one month may not be the same the next. Agility is key. Listen to your audience, analyse your performance, have fun – but stay true to the space your brand plays in.”BE PLAYFUL WITH YOUR BRAND ASSETSThrough its Art of Burberry franchise, Burberry partners with artists to express its brand in unexpected places. “We benefit from an array of instantly recognisable IP,” explains Whitlock. “For instance, we custom-created some content with pasta – leaning into the FoodTok and How-To space.”Playfully transforming the Burberry Check and Monogram into ravioli, lasagne and tagliatelle, Burberry Pasta is one of Burberry’s most successful TikTok videos to-date. “It led to a wave of new followers for us,” reveals global paid lead Naomi Harris. “Seeing content that was Burberry-branded but not trying to sell anything really resonated with viewers.”Other Art of Burberry instalments have leveraged other unmistakable brand assets, from moulding the Icon Stripe out of jelly to animating the Birch Brown Check in creative ways. “The Burberry Check, despite iterations, has fundamentally gone unchanged since its creation,” Whitlock points out. “There’s a massive opportunity for us to reinvigorate a 100-year-old design for Gen Z, in a way that makes sense for them.”ENGAGE THE WIDER CREATOR COMMUNITYSmart partnerships can expand your brand’s reach, unlocking potential for high-impact creative campaigns that transcend their platform of origin and make a splash IRL too.For instance, Rimmel London teamed up with TikTok and Storm Models for #DiscoverMe, a search for talented beauty content creators to join Storm’s roster of models, as well as becoming a Rimmel ambassador for a year. “TikTok had the scale of talented users to enter, and the structure of the platform allowed people to participate weekly and drive hype through hashtag challenges,” explains Cardiff.Rimmel has also found traction in humorous content, so long as it feels real and unpolished. “Reacting to current funny trends or filters performs well organically for us,” Cardiff continues. “It’s exactly the type of content that TikTok is known for: entertaining, fun, relevant and different to the content experience on other platforms.”COLLABORATE WITH LIKE-MINDED BRANDSBurberry has also had plenty of success with longer-form collaborations, such as its Sylvanian Dramas series – which clock in at over a minute apiece, featuring Burberry products as a subtle but integral part of the story.“Sylvanian Drama is a creator, but also a cultural entity,” says Whitlock. “That meant we were part of the zeitgeist – the holy grail of social media marketing.” But to do that authentically, he continues, communities need enough space to be creative.“The critical part of any TikTok collaboration is giving the creator an opportunity to interpret the brief,” is Whitlock’s advice. “They know their channel and they know what works, so you need to let go of certain elements. I can’t overstate the importance of giving creatives freedom.”Another collaboration with popular TikTok creator Are You Happy? provided an outlet to create, in Harris’ words: “Content that was thought-provoking and beautiful ­– yet filled with Burberry outerwear.” Handing over the creative reins to the channel ensured nothing felt forced or inauthentic.FIND TRENDS TO BRING YOUR IDEAS TO LIFELanguage-learning app Duolingo has built a TikTok following of over 4.5 million. “We chase ideas rather than trends,” explains global social media manager Zaria Parvez. “That doesn’t mean you can’t have trending content on your page, but we base it on strong ideas that we know our audience will love. We just wait for a trend to match that idea.”One ongoing series explores Duolingo mascot Duo the Owl’s unrequited love for Dua Lipa, making use of the latest TikTok trends about crushes. “We spend a lot of time on TikTok watching content from a range of other creators and monitoring trending audio, jokes and so on,” Parvez reveals. “We have a great team of TikTok natives, and strong brand values – the mix of the two allow us to have a strong POV in our content.”“Staying on top of trends comes naturally when you spend your time scrolling,” agrees Harris. “React to what fits your brand. If we were to follow every viral effect, sound, or theme it would naturally feel forced. Instead, we create what works – when it works.”For instance, a short video of Burberry’s Floating Meadow for the Platinum Jubilee was a neat fit for Cardi B’s viral ‘OMG what is that!’ sound. And the viral ‘Picasso’ sound matched well with Puzzle content for a recent Monogram campaign. “We had content that fit the sound, so we used it,” she says. “We didn’t need to scramble to create something immediately, which makes it feel more natural.”TAILOR YOUR APPROACH TO THE PLATFORMOne-size-fits-all content recycled from other social platforms simply won’t wash with the TikTok community. “I’ve always seen TikTok as a great leveller,” reflects Whitlock. “Creativity prevails. It underpins the return to authentic, of-the-moment content that social media was founded on. It’s exciting, but also a challenge for us in the luxury space.”The concept of levelling the playing field resonates with Parvez’s team at Duolingo. “There’s huge potential for smaller brands to get creative on the platform, even if their budgets are limited,” she says. “TikTok is all about creativity and showing your point of view, not big production budgets and large-scale brand campaigns.”Whitlock adds that many brands focus all their energy on one facet of the TikTok universe, such as transitions, and lose sight of the bigger picture. “TikTok is so much more than that,” he concludes. “It’s about emotive storytelling, authentic collaboration and community. And it’s one of the only places you can land vigour with an almost exclusively Gen Z audience.”Are you the ‘Greatest Of All Time’? Enter the first ever TikTok Awards here",", Burberry has over 55,000 followers on the platform. Burberry has a 1.5 million-strong following on the platform – and it takes creativity, not budget, to cut through effectively. “You won’t have success on TikTok if you don’t use it,” says Alex Whitlock, social media director at Burberry. “We benefit from an array of instantly recognisable IP,” says Whitlock."
