CULTURE NEWS,https://www.euronews.com/culture/2023/05/29/flushless-toilets-and-a-popup-shop-the-must-see-pavilions-at-the-2023-venice-architecture-,The must-see pavilions at the 2023 Venice Architecture Biennale,Rebecca Ann Hughes,2023-05-29,"This year’s Architecture Biennale in Venice is wacky, thought-provoking and inspiring. Curator Lesley Lokko, of Scottish-Ghanaian origins, has shone the spotlight on Africa with over half the participants from the continent or its diaspora.Installations and exhibitions tackle topics of climate change, colonialism and indigenous culture.But with so much extraordinary culture on display, a visit to the vast Biennale can be overwhelming. There are 27 pavilions in the Giardini and 22 in the Arsenale as well as 14 dotted through Venice.Here’s our guide to the must-see exhibitions and pavilions at the 18th edition of the international festival.Finland’s contribution to the Biennale begins just outside the Alvar Aalto-designed pavilion with what looks like a Duchamp-esque conceptual sculpture.In a rectangular pit, a broken ceramic toilet bowl is half buried in the earth. This is intended as a staged reconstruction of an archaeological excavation that “symbolically consigns the flushing toilet to history,” according to the Dry Collective group behind the project.Inside the pavilion, the exhibition presents a Finnish sanitation solution for the future. In the centre is a wood panelled structure housing a huussi – a composting toilet used by thousands of Finnish people living in rural settings.“We cannot live on a planet where billions of people use rapidly diminishing fresh water resources to flush their waste,” says curator Arja Renell.“Huussi inspires and invites all professionals to start looking for alternative solutions which would better serve the world we inhabit today.”The light-filled Pavilion of Nordic Countries is an aesthetic jumble of reindeer skin tents, logs carved into seating and wooden huts.At the heart of the installation is artist and architect Joar Nango’s archive of books about Indigenous architecture collected over 15 years.Girjegumpi: The Sámi Architecture Library is a social space which has already travelled to different locations in the Nordic region.It invites visitors to use the pavilion as a reading room to learn about topics including Sámi architecture and design, ancestral building knowledge, activism and decolonisation.Pushing aside a black curtain, visitors to Uzbekistan’s pavilion in the Arsenale find themselves in a dimly lit space confronted with a brick-walled labyrinth.The structure takes inspiration from the traditional building material of ancient fortresses known as qalas in the Karakalpakstan region, although the bricks themselves were reclaimed from the area around Venice.The maze is also intended as a symbol of contemporary architecture having lost its way as buildings continue to be designed without consideration for a warmer future.In a few of the walls, a spotlight shines on brilliant blue ceramic tiles. These enamelled inserts were made by Uzbek artist Abdulvahid Bukhoriy, one of the few remaining craftsmen of the blue Bukhara technique.In Brazil's national pavilion, curators Gabriela de Matos and Paulo Tavares deconstruct the founding myth of Brasília, a capital built in “the middle of nowhere.”As they explain through text and maps, the area was actually home to Indigenous and Quilombola populations who were driven out by colonisers.In a second room, a floor and structures made from earth (the exhibition is titled “Terra [Earth]"") immerse visitors in the fundamental, ancestral materials of Brazil.By far the brightest pavilion, Latvia’s installation is a celebration of its tenth year at the Architecture Biennale with a “supermarket of ideas.”There’s a check out at the front while the rest of the room is divided into aisles stacked with colourful products.Shaped like different supermarket items - detergent, tinned tomatoes, jam - flat cutouts present the pavilion concepts from the last 10 Biennale shows.The curators used AI technology to feed in content about past exhibitions and short descriptions were then printed onto over 500 items to line the supermarket’s shelves.The supermarket has a distinct pop art vibe, recalling the critiques of consumption by artists like Andy Warhol.","is a jumble of reindeer skin tents, logs carved into seating and wooden huts.It invites visitors to use the pavilion as a reading room to learn about topics including Sámi architecture and design.","Installations and exhibitions tackle topics of climate change, colonialism and indigenous culture."
CULTURE NEWS,https://www.euronews.com/culture/2023/05/26/at-the-2023-venice-biennale-empowered-african-creatives-lead-architecture-into-the-future,"At the 2023 Venice Biennale, the future of architecture is Africa",Rebecca Ann Hughes,2023-05-26,"In the past few years, European dominance over culture and display has been disrupted. Nations until now largely left out of the story of art and architecture have been calling for a rewrite, beginning with the restitution of numerous stolen heritage objects.The Venice Biennale is joining this growing drive to redress the balance - one exhibit is actually the design for a structure in Nigeria to house the returned Benin Bronzes.For the first time, the international exhibition has a curator of African origin. Scottish-Ghanaian Lesley Lokko has ensured the continent takes the spotlight; more than half the participants are from Africa or the African diaspora.The Biennale, historically dominated by a euro-centric vision with minor participation from Asia and the Americas, is being led by Africa this year.Lokko’s show makes bold, forward-thinking statements about who will lead the discipline of architecture into the future.Alongside Africa, decarbonisation is another key theme of her exhibition and she shows that the two are inextricably connected.As the world warms, the architecture sector needs to look to the countries already building for the heat.One gallery in the Central Pavilion of the Giardini has been transformed by Nigerian-born Olalekan Jeyifous into a fantastical futuristic imagining of the continent freed from the hangover of colonialism and its economic exploitation of Africa.The installation has transformed a room into a bright, leafy space employing green technologies and Indigenous knowledge systems. It represents the “All-African Protoport,” a transport hub for low-impact, zero-emissions land, sea and air travel.The 2023 Biennale also looks to historic architecture movements and gives space to African creatives to correct their narratives. As Lokko says, “the ‘story’ of architecture is incomplete. Not wrong, but incomplete.”In the Applied Arts Pavilion of the Arsenale, a long corridor (deliberately mimicking the architectural style discussed in the installation) presents a visual and descriptive history of tropical modernism.The movement merged the international modernist style with knowledge of the hot, humid conditions in western Africa.Tropical modernism has long been defined as a colonial style, funded by the British Colonial Office. But, as the V&A who curated the exhibition write, “the style survived the transition to Independence, when it became a key aspect of nation-building and symbol of the progressiveness and internationalism of these new countries.”Their installation, which also includes a 30 minute video, aims to “complicate the history of tropical modernism by engaging with and centring African perspectives.”Niger makes its debut at the 18th edition of the international exhibition. Archifusion, housed on the island of San Servolo, is an emeshing of African and Western cultures giving rise to a cultural “laboratory.”The installation is built around a kind of brick - the brique magique - made with locally-sourced materials in Niger.The shape and structure of the humble construction material has been modified to improve its thermal inertia and stability for buildings of the future.",", of the African continent, of tropical modernism.The installation has transformed a room into a bright, leafy space using green technologies and Indigenous knowledge systems.

It’s full to bursting with inspiration for even the least green-fingered garden fans and no matter how small or large your outdoor space, it’s possible to take aspects from the award-winning designs and apply them to your own garden.Common themes at this year’s flower show are muted colours - lots of whites, pale yellows and purples - the ongoing rewilding versus manicured garden debate, sustainability, accessibility and drought tolerant planting to combat rising temperatures.On Tuesday 23 May, awards were handed out at the world’s most prestigious gardening event - here are the top prize winners…Best Show Garden: Horatio's Garden designed by Charlotte Harris and Hugo BuggPaid a visit by Queen Camilla, the garden meets the needs of people with mobility issues and embraces the mission of the Horatio’s Garden charity which aims to create and nurture beautiful, accessible gardens in NHS spinal injuries centres.Best Construction Award (Show Garden): The Centrepoint Garden designed by Cleve WestThis striking garden, featuring a ruined house, weeds and a tree torn from its roots, aims to serve as a metaphor for what it means to be young and homeless. The Centrepoint charity helps those young people without a home and the garden incorporates around 120,000 dots, highlighting the number of homeless youths in the UK.Best Sanctuary Garden: The National Brain Appeal's Rare Space designed by Charlie Hawkes / Best Construction Award (Sanctuary Garden)This space, which won two awards, was designed to be enjoyed by people living with dementia, featuring bright visuals and calming surroundings, including a textured path, brightly coloured seating, soothing water features and sheltered spaces for those afflicted.Best Balcony & Container Garden: Feels Like Home designed by Rosemary ColdstreamThis small garden was inspired by Coldstream’s childhood in New Zealand and features sculptural plants, rich colours and natural materials which come together to make the space 'feel like home' for the designer. It also touches on the theme of the increasing necessity for drought resistant plants for a changing climate across the globe.Best All About Plants Garden: The Talitha Arts Garden designed by Joe and Laura CareyThis design celebrates the creative arts and their therapeutic power to help those who’ve suffered trauma. It uses a minimalist palette focusing on the contrast between darkness and light and uses sculpture and muted colours as a metaphor for trauma recovery.Other highlights from Chelsea Flower ShowIn a Chelsea first, designer Manoj Malde married his partner of 33 years, Clive Gillmor, in his own garden at the show.It’s the only wedding ever held at the Flower Show in its 110 year history and was particularly significant for this year’s theme of diversity and inclusion and was celebrated by the RHS. Judge Alexander-Sinclair said, told the PA news agency: “It’s a Chelsea first and Chelsea one-off – it’s not something you expect to happen at a flower show”, adding, “Isn’t it a glorious idea? Somebody who actually designs this garden about bringing people together, then gets married [in] it. It’s a nice way to connect the whole thing”.Very few animals are allowed at Chelsea due to safety concerns - in fact, bees were removed from The Newt’s garden in case of stings - so one four-legged visitor was the toast of the show.Daisy, a dog rescued from a puppy farm, enchanted visitors as the official mascot of the RSPCA’s garden. As well as raising awareness of the charity, the designers explained they’re aiming to inspire gardeners, calling them, “the secret weapon against wildlife decline”.Celebrities are a mainstay of the opening of Chelsea Flower Show and this year's star-studded guest list didn't disappoint.As well as a visit from the King and Queen, Princess Kate joined Chelsea pensioners - ex-military members who live on the grounds of the Royal Hospital - as well as picnicking with school children.Oscar-winning veteran actress Judi Dench was in attendance as well as 'Succession star' Matthew Macfayden and his wife Keeley Hawes.Stars of the silver screen, including Jim Broadbent, 'Downton Abbey' actor Jim Carter and 'Absolutely Fabulous' Patsy - AKA Joanna Lumley - enjoyed the gardens on display.Not to be mistaken for the King himself, actor Dominic West - who portrayed Charles in 'The Crown' posed for photos at the Flower Show. Euronews Culture spoke to many attendees and the consensus was, although the favourite gardens mentioned didn’t win any top awards, the stand outs were…RHS Garden of Royal Reflection and Celebration designed by Dave GreenThis small garden, commissioned by the RHS and therefore not eligible for judging, used plants favoured by the royal family, specifically King Charles III and the late Queen Elizabeth II, as well as elements used at royal residences. Designed to celebrate the Coronation of King Charles, it features a bronze sculpture of the new monarch.A Letter from a Million Years Past designed by Jihae HwangThis impressive garden features a large herb drying structure, usually found in the eastern part of Jirisan - known as 'the mother mountain of South Korea'. The design uses rocks weighing more than 200 tonnes which form a recreation of that mountain, as well as trees, plants and herbs selected for their healing and medicinal properties.The Biophilic Garden Otsu - Hanare designed by Kazuyuki IshiharaA ‘must see’ for Chelsea visitors, this garden focuses on the Japanese 'hanare', is a small house separated from the main building, considered to be a place of healing. Using moss and water features, this design is one of the most peaceful at the entire event.While all awards given by RHS judges have been handed out, the People's Choice winner is set to be announced on Friday, 26 May.",",,,,,, a creme de la creme of gardening exhibitions opened this week - and Euronews Culture was at the start of Chelsea Flower Show in London to bring you a rundown of all the best things to look out for - whether you’re visiting or admiring the designs from afar.

CULTURE NEWS,https://www.euronews.com/culture/2023/05/25/a-visible-vacancy-why-venice-blocked-austrias-biennale-pavilion-proposal,Why Venice blocked Austria’s Biennale pavilion proposal,Rebecca Ann Hughes,2023-05-25,"Austria's pavilion at the 2023 Venice Architecture Biennale opened to the public last weekend as an incomplete project.The proposed installation, titled Partecipazione / Beteiligung, was given a hard no from Venice authorities.Ironically, this rejection actually proves the point that the Austrian pavilion’s curators were trying to make.So why was the pavilion so controversial?The Austrian pavilion is situated in the Giardini at the northeastern border wall that separates the Biennale from the city. Over the wall is the area of Sant'Elena, a mainly residential zone of Venice.Architecture collective AKT and Viennese architect Hermann Czech proposed building a bridge as part of the installation that would link the city neighbourhood to half of the pavilion.The idea was to give residents of Venice free access to the space (although not to the Biennale as a whole). This area was to be “assigned” to the population of Sant’Elena as a place for urban initiatives and social exchange.The idea of the Austrian pavilion was motivated by mounting criticism from local community and activist groups that the international exhibition does not benefit the city’s population.The project would have quite literally given space back to the surrounding city, a reversal of the expansion over the last decades of the Biennale zone.In the first room of the pavilion, a display of imagery and descriptions details how the international exhibition has expanded and usurped space in a city where land is limited.Local initiatives have criticised the exclusive use of space and called for the Giardini and the Arsenale to be opened up to residents all year round.“[This] would, as well as benefiting Venice’s citizens, make the link between the Biennale and Venice stronger and more dynamic,” reads a quote from the authors of newspaper Il Giornale dell'Arte displayed in the installation.“We are profoundly committed to preventing the parts of the Arsenale not occupied from being transformed into a shell for trade fair activities and the Biennale exhibitions, which can only be accessed by paying an entrance fee,” reads another comment from Forum Futuro Arsenale.Upon presenting their project to the Biennale and city authorities, the curators of the Austrian Pavilion found their ideas refused.Minutes from a meeting, posted up in the installation, report that the project could not be approved because the “administration cannot create the precedence of an entrance that is not part of the Biennale’s area for security reasons.”As such, in the courtyard of the pavilion there is a half constructed metal bridge. You can climb up the steps to look over the wall into the Sant’Elena neighbourhood.The incomplete bridge and empty courtyard now speak volumes about the role of the Biennale in the local community.“Instead of a bustling laboratory, the pavilion’s half originally intended for public use will become a visible vacancy, a permanent construction site underscoring the central question of the project,” say the curators.","is a reversal of the expansion over the last decades of the Biennale zone.Ironically, this rejection actually proves the point that the Austrian pavilion’s curators were trying to make.the pavilion at the 2023 Venice Architecture Biennale opened to the public last weekend as an incomplete project.","The proposed installation, titled Partecipazione / Beteiligung, was given a hard no from Venice authorities."
TOUCH,https://www.euronews.com/culture/2023/05/18/designers-and-their-homes-alexander-lerviks-swedish-kit-house-renovation,Look inside Alexander Lervik's renovated kit house south of Stockholm,Saskia O'Donoghue,2023-05-18,"High-profile Scandinavian designer Alexander Lervik wasn’t sure that he’d adjust to life outside of Stockholm after being a city dweller for years but, since moving to his redesigned house with Elin, his communications strategist wife and their children, he hasn’t looked back.Their home in the archipelago of in Saltsjöbaden, just south of the Swedish capital, needed total renovation and the Lerviks undertook the project with aplomb. Originally a kit house from 1961 - it’s said that over 80% of single-family homes in Sweden have been ordered from a catalogue - the design-focused pair made sure to improve their home with a focus on sustainable materials, timeless design and longevity.Alexander Lervik told Euronews Culture that the restoration was no mean feat: “The building process itself took 9 months so with planning almost 1.5 years. We moved in before construction was completely finished because we got rid of our other accommodation, but it was basically finished indoors so it was okay.”The family moved into the three-storey property in the autumn of 2021 and drew on Alexander’s long career as a furniture and lighting designer for leading Scandinavian producers and international companies such as Italy’s Moroso.Sustainability was at the forefront of Alexander’s plans when he planned the renovation of the house, with the designer explaining, “we have made sustainable choices so that the house can stand over generations. It has cost more but has a completely different quality in, for example, solid oak floors that can be sanded 10-15 times.” He added, “We have reused brick in the parts where we opened up windows and used that brick for the new extension. We also got hold of old roof tiles of the same type as the existing roof so that we could replace broken ones instead of buying a whole new roof.”The home’s largened windows are a particular favourite of Alexander’s and, he says, the family start every morning with an impressive view of a forest outside of the house, which was partially hidden before the restoration.Alexander is also particularly proud of the house’s elevator, the Aritco HomeLift, which he originally designed in 2016. He tells Euronews Culture that every new visitor on arriving at the home, “immediately wants to try [it] out”.Before moving in to the house, the Lerviks bought a lot of furniture and art at various auction houses and pieces by contemporary designers Philippe Starck, Monica Förster, Achille Castiglioni among others, mixing them in with pieces of his own design and sculptures made by his parents. Despite being spoiled for choice, he says his favourite part of the house is the impressive picture wall in the home’s airy kitchen.While the garden is mostly Elin’s domain - Alexander explains, “my wife is most passionate about the garden and sows seeds herself in early spring so that in summer it is completely overflowing with beautiful flowers” - it’s still a work-in-progress for the couple. The outdoor space, also home to the family’s pet rabbits, is currently undergoing a makeover which will add a terrace of flower beds to the existing garden.Despite the few tweaks still to be made, Alexander says his property is a very happy place for him, saying, “I've never felt as at home as I do in this house - a lot of that is because we tore down the entire interior of the house and created a completely new floor plan with new window sections and completely new positions on the walls, bathroom and kitchen. It is completely made according to how my wife and I think a home should function and feel”.In terms of advice for people inspired by the Lerviks' style, Alexander says it’s best to throw caution to the wind: “Dare to go outside the box and add items to your home that you wouldn't normally choose… [go for] something that teases your mind [as that] can do wonders for the overall feel of a home”.To learn more about Alexander Lervik’s custom home elevator, visit www.aritco.com/",",,,,,,, was originally a kit house from 1961 - it’s said that over 80% of single-family homes in Sweden have been ordered from a catalogue.Alexander Lervik says the restoration was no mean feat: “we have made sustainable choices so that the house can stand over generations”.Alexander is particularly proud of the house’s elevator, the Aritco HomeLift, which he originally designed in 2016.","As part of our series on designers' homes, Euronews Culture takes a look inside Alexander Lervik's property just south of Stockholm."
CULTURE NEWS,https://www.euronews.com/culture/2023/05/12/euronews-cultures-guide-to-london-craft-week-2023,Euronews Culture's guide to London Craft Week 2023,Saskia O'Donoghue,2023-05-12,"The rise in people choosing to buy craft pieces for their homes is showing no sign of slowing down.According to a 2020 report by the British Crafts Council, the UK market for handmade items grew from £883 million (approximately €1 billion) in 2006 to more than £3 billion (roughly €3.45 billion) by 2019.Post COVID-19 pandemic, many of us are increasingly trying to make the places we live more homely and individual and most people are more aware of the amount and provenance of pieces we choose.Consumers are making choices to buy fewer things in a more conscious way for environmental reasons as well as supporting local makers rather than huge, mass-producing corporations.Following on from last month’s Milan Design Week, which focused heavily on sustainability in design, 2023’s London Craft Week is underway and while the British Crafts Council report found that some 33 percent of consumers (10.3 million people in the UK alone) are more likely to buy online, the entire city has been taken over by the best of craft from the UK and around the globe.This year’s event marks the ninth iteration and features the work and skills of over 400 iterations in numerous markets and exhibitions as well as at talks and workshops. Euronews Culture looks at some of the highlights not to be missed.It’s been a big week for the British royal family, with King Charles III being crowned on Saturday. The Windsors have also long been great supporters of British craft makers. In fact, more than 800 UK companies have been awarded royal warrants in recognition of their service to the crown.Craft Week is celebrating this special relationship with a number of these royal warranted companies opening up for tours and demonstrations.There will be a masterclass in grooming at Truefitt & Hill and talks from the hat-maker Lock & Co and cordwainer John Lobb and a tour of the atelier of Rachel Trevor-Morgan, which made hats for the late Queen Elizabeth II.The Royal Mint’s chief engraver will demonstrate how King Charles III’s new coin was made and Floris is putting on a perfume-making workshop.The National Army Museum will give visitors a chance to explore the craftsmanship behind ceremonial dress and British military uniforms as well as hosting ‘Embroidering Identity: Goldwork’, an embroidery course led by Hand & Lock who recently painstakingly hand-embroidered Penny Mordaunt’s standout outfit at the coronation.Leighton House Museum will offer a tour by Turquoise Mountain, the NGO co-founded in 2006 by King Charles, which will show off the work of ceramicists, jewellers and woodworkers from Afghanistan and the Levant.A post shared by Leighton and Sambourne Museums (@leightonsambournemuseums)The winner of the 2022 Loewe Foundation Craft prize, Dahye Jeong, will be a particular standout at this year’s event. She creates delicate baskets and bowls that are so fine and intricate they look as if they’re made of lace but, in fact, they’re actually woven from horsehair.It’s a technique used in Jeong’s homeland of South Korea to make headwear for men since the 14th century and her pieces will go on show, presented by Soluna Crafts, at Cromwell Place.Jeong’s exhibition will be complemented by a group exhibition at the Korean Culture Centre. Light of Weaving: Labour-Hand-Hours will present pieces of contemporary Korean weaving, using traditional materials including horse hair as well as bamboo, wood and glass.Celebrating the best of British design will be the flagship Vivienne Westwood store in Conduit Street. As a tribute to the rebellious, avant garde eponymous designer, the brand will put on an exhibition called ‘Vivienne Westwood Corsets: 1987 to Present Day’, which includes corsets made by Westwood for her Harris Tweed collection. The display will carry on past the end of Craft Week, running until 21 May and aims to delve into a hallmark of the designer’s work - and one which goes hand-in-hand with British craftsmanship through the ages, with her having played a significant part in liberating corsets from being restrictive undergarments to a glamorous choice for outerwear.London’s iconic Oxo Tower is presenting the work of more than 70 leading makers from across Europe at its Bargehouse, as part of the Future Icons Selects project. Visitors have the opportunity to learn more about an array of contemporary craft disciplines from the creation of aesthetic artworks to functional objects take part in numerous workshops and meet the people behind the designs. Also at the Oxo Tower’s Wharf Gallery, artist collective The Tangible Project will show a group exhibition exploring the relationship between crafts people's hands and the individual making of wood, clay, textiles and glass. Eight artists are to be featured, including Loraine Rutt, Amélie Crépy and Line Nilsen.A post shared by Oxo Tower Wharf (@oxotowerwharf)London Craft Week is paying host to numerous champions of sustainable design and craft, including Anabela Chan, the world’s first fine jewellery brand to make use of gemstones grown in laboratories. The brand, famed for their considered and circular approach to materials, will also present their creations, including the ‘Mermaid’s Tale’ - a collection made using recycled and refined aluminium cans from beach cleanups.Also highlighting the importance of sustainability in craft is The Mills Fabrica, the Innovation Partner of Craft Week for the third year running. They are presenting a series of panels, keynote speeches and conversations on the theme of ‘Planet-Saving Innovations’ from their hub in Kings Cross. Luxury fashion brands and innovators including Ganni, Farfetch and Fabrican feature on the programme and a biomaterials exhibition at gallery and concept store Fabrica X will shine a light on heritage techniques as well as contemporary craftsmanship made by scientists and bio-designers.The Mills Fabrica is also hosting workshops including a screen-printing session using bacterial dyeing technology and a bio-embellishment and embroidery event hosted by CQ Studio, which will give participants the chance to make sequins from seaweed.For the first time at Craft Week, 2023’s event is welcoming the Park Royal Design District in north-west London. As part of an initiative by the Mayor of London’s Creative Enterprise Zones, visitors have the chance to see two new exhibitions. Park Royal Clay explores the work of eight makers using raw London clay from infrastructure projects while Future Craft showcases designers working at the intersection of traditional techniques and cutting-edge technologies.That includes Blast Studio, who use waste to make sustainable furniture and artefacts using 3D printing and living organisms like mycelium, the root network of fungiThere’s a focus on sustainability too, with a programme of talks including discussions on ‘The Craft of Fashion: How to Stay Sustainable and Future Facing’ featuring local designers and another, ‘Re-Imagining Material for Architectural Design’, which will explore the future of sustainable materials in building and interiors.London Craft Week runs until 14 May and the full programme can be found here.","and, and a masterclass in grooming at Truefitt & Hill, John Lobb and a tour of the atelier of Rachel Trevor-Morgan.The National Army Museum will give visitors a chance to explore the craftsmanship behind ceremonial dress and British military uniforms.","London Design Week is back for a ninth time, celebrating sustainability and groundbreaking technology in design and craftsmanship across the city"

The exhibition traces these themes of sustainability and anticipation of the future:""The birth of the practice in the 1960s coincided with the first signs of an awareness of the fragility of the planet. These were the green shoots of what would later be named The Green Movement,"" explains Foster.""These principles may now be mainstream, but more than half a century ago, they were revolutionary and anticipated the reality of today. Throughout the decades, we have sought to challenge conventions, reinvent building types and demonstrate an architecture of light and lightness, inspired by nature, which can be about joy as well as being eco-friendly.""A post shared by Centre Pompidou (@centrepompidou)The exhibition runs until August 7, 2023, and is organised by the Centre Pompidou, with the participation of Foster + Partners and the Norman Foster Foundation.",",,,,,,,.,, has opened at the Centre Pompidou in Paris, spanning the last six decades of his career.The exhibition runs until August 7, 2023, and is organised by the Centre Pompidou.The largest retrospective of works by British architect, Norman Foster has opened at the Centre Pompidou in Paris, covering the last six decades of his career.","Six decades of works by the world renowned British architect who is often seen as a leader of the ""high-tech"" trend are now on display at the Centre Pompidou in Paris."

The cave-like atrium entrance is an intriguing landscape on its own, inspired by canyons and caves in the West. The façade is clad in Milford pink granite – the same stone used for the Museum's entrance on Central Park West. The Gilder Center has been nearly a decade in the making and cost approximately €423 million ($465 million) to construct. Further inside, the centre features a new interactive insect exhibition, including an insectarium and butterfly vivarium where visitors can mingle with hundreds of moths and butterflies. A stunning immersive show called 'Invisible Worlds' is also part of the wonders on-site, illustrating how all life on Earth is connected. At an age of increasing worry over climate change and loss of biodiversity, this seems to be just the place to visit. “In terms of trying to understand our intersecting crises of biodiversity and climate change, I think our research and what we're exhibiting here should get people to really pause and think about that,"" says American Museum of Natural History Provost of Science Cheryl Hayashi. A post shared by American Museum of Natural History (@amnh)""Actually we have pretty significant insect decline going on all around the world. And why is that? What is the role of habitat loss, the role of temperature change?

TOUCH,https://www.euronews.com/culture/2023/05/04/designers-and-their-homes-a-derbyshire-1990s-time-capsule,Designers and their homes - A Derbyshire 1990s time capsule,Saskia O'Donoghue,2023-05-04,"Despite being born in the late 1990s, Jack Walters is a huge fan of the decade - and his wonderful home in the Peak District in Derbyshire reflects his love for the halcyon days pre-millennium.Jack and his boyfriend Matt moved to the property in the village of Litton in the East Midlands of England just under four years ago and he told Euronews Culture it’s taken nearly that long to transform the house into its current glory.When they moved in, every room was painted white and the ‘90s kitchen units had been grey - which Jack says, “made the room feel very cold”. This stark appearance didn’t put Jack off though, he explains, “The house was a blank canvas which worked in our favour”.The 1990s decor is the antithesis of clean lines and sometimes bland, minimalistic trends often found in homes today - and Gen Z are fans too, with over 18,000 people following his TikTok account which documents his admiration for the decade.Jack loves the ‘90s look as bold colours and patterns were layered in unusual ways - and because it harks back to a time when technology was far more simple than it is now.“As a self confessed social media addict not having any connection seems daunting but not knowing any difference was a luxury my parents had and I’m sometimes envious of that,” he says, “The cosy decor and close family connections without social media and smartphones drew me in and it went from there”.Jack has always been inspired by all aspects of ‘90s culture from the music - favourites include Blur and the Spice Girls - to the cars. He owns a 1999 Daihatsu Cuore and a 1995 Ford Mondeo which he tinkers with in his spare time, when he’s not studying for his Masters degree in ceramics or working in a pottery shop.He has happy memories of childhood outings going to flea markets and charity shops and that tradition hasn’t stopped, with thrift shops now added into the mix.The interior design of Jack’s home is also inspired by his late grandmother’s house, which included a chicken themed kitchen and green living room. He says, “She had such a playful approach to interior design especially in the ‘90s. Despite not being a creative person her home had a flare that was authentically her and I always wanted to recreate it”.Jack’s own kitchen is decorated in a kitschy lemon theme, which he plucked from a 1997 Laura Ashley magazine - he says he loves how fun and cheerful it is.That feeling is mirrored by visitors to the home who, Jack explains, always compliment him on how homey and cosy it is - and how it awakens the nostalgia of their childhoods.Jack is dedicated to making his ‘90s space as authentic as possible and isn’t afraid to spend years tracking down specific pieces. One abstract print rug in his sitting room took him 5 years to find - and he’s still on the hunt for a ‘90s IKEA Vajer chest of drawers which is near impossible to come by.If you’re keen to emulate Jack’s interior style vibe, he says the number one necessity is colour, saying, “As soon as we added colour to our home it came alive. The grey interiors of today have never appealed to me and I’ve always found colours can really affect your mood and well-being”.Having spent years on the hunt for specific pieces to add to his home, he also advises patience and persistence, explaining it’s crucial to take your time to find the perfect element for your dream look. Jack also says not to overlook anywhere at all for that ideal item, urging, “Look everywhere, online charity shops, skips, garden sales anywhere you can find a hidden gem or a bargain”.","in the late 1990s, Jack Walters is a huge fan of the decade - and his home in the Peak District in Derbyshire reflects his love for the halcyon days pre-millennium.Jack has always been inspired by all aspects of ‘90s culture from the music - favourites include Blur and the Spice Girls - to the cars.","Don't look back in anger if you're missing the 90's as you're not alone.

TOUCH,https://www.euronews.com/culture/2023/05/03/milan-design-week-2023-here-are-a-few-of-our-favourite-things,Milan Design Week 2023: Our top picks of this year's iconic Salone,Saskia O'Donoghue,2023-05-03,"Euronews Culture spent a wonderful week last month at the Milan Furniture Fair - or Salone Internazionale del Mobile di Milano - for the event’s 61st edition.  It was the first Salone since the COVID-19 pandemic and attracting hundreds of thousands of visitors. It’s the largest fair of its kind in the world, showcasing the latest and best in furniture, homewares and design from across the globe and more than 2,500 companies put their wares on display between the vast Fiera Milano exhibition space as well as in the city centre. 2023’s themes shed light on sustainable design, innovative materials, urban regeneration and artificial intelligence as a tool to sit side-by-side with man-made design, rather than replace it. We’d love to tell you about every single exhibit but, as mere mortals, we’re offering a round up of ten of our favourite things we saw during the week.The Salone is a chance not just to celebrate what’s new in design, but also to see parts of Milan not usually open to visitors. Armani/Casa proved this point with their display, opening up Armani HQ at the stunning Palazzo Orsini to celebrate the launch of their first ever outdoor collection of furniture and furnishings. The new pieces were put on show in both the Palazzo’s gardens and its frescoed rooms usually reserved for Haute Couture clients and included sun loungers, sofas, tables and ornaments with cactus and lotus flower theming.Other highlights included weaving themes throughout the furniture offerings - in typical Armani style - and the accompanying fabrics and upholstery in hues familiar to connoisseurs of the brand or printed in their signature palm motifs.New versions of Armani’s indoor collections were on display too, with a mother-of-pearl chair, dressing table and desk as standouts.Playing into two of the themes of 2023’s Salone - shedding light on the use of sustainable design and innovative materials in furniture and homewares - were very much at play in the collaboration between Takeda Katsuya Design studio, based in the Brera District of Milan and Japanese design house Tatehiko, based in the Japanese city of Ashikaga.Building on past shared projects, the BRACE collection put on show at Design Week is a new line of easy-to assemble furniture pieces, consisting of a side table, a low table and a shelf, all characterised by the company’s signature diagonal lines, adding to both the strength and aesthetic appeal. Tatehiko, which has been in existence since 1892 is small, employing around 20 craftspeople, and makes use of traditional techniques, passed down over the generations since the company’s founding. Each piece is handmade and the philosophy behind the company is that nothing is wasted; the pieces in the BRACE collection are all small offcuts from larger furniture designs which use Hinoki wood from the Tochigi forest. The wood is rare as it’s hard to grow outside of very specific environmental conditions, so it’s important to use every piece that is harvested.Katsuya explains that the slim elements of the BRACE collection means they can be shipped worldwide in small packages, lessening emissions and working towards a climate friendly industry.Also on display at the Takeda Katsuya Design studio were similarly sustainable pieces, made by master shoemaker Fukaya Hidetaka. He uses offcuts of Italian leather from his larger creations to make furniture like chaise longues and flower vases, ensuring nothing goes to waste.If BRACE was all about minimalism, then Seletti’s new offerings for the Salone were the total opposite. The Italian design house almost screamed its arrival at Milan Design Week, with an enormous model of a pair of legs, complete with Seletti-branded plaster, and a huge cat with a heart shaped bottom welcoming visitors to the installation at their flagship store in the centre of the city.Walking through the building - which acts as its shop and showroom and, as such, is still open for visitors - guests could see many of Seletti’s iconic collaborations, including the famous TOILETPAPER designs, which include the lipstick mirror, Classics on Acid by Diesel Living and Antonia Arico’s Magna Graecia collection, a take on ancient Roman and Greek ceramics with a modern twist.It was the courtyard garden to the back of the space which was the real star of Seletti’s Salone show. Dotted around were multiple monster-covered boxes designed by artist Gianpiero D’Alessandro, who has collaborated with Justin Bieber and Snoop Dogg among others. Inside these boxes are the new launches for Seletti from a number of established and up-and-coming homeware designers.Favourites included the ‘Seletti Circus’, featuring lamps by Uto Balmoral, who keeps his real identity a secret. Each piece consists of an asymmetrical striped circus tent lampshade with circus-themed figures, like a strongman or burlesque dancer, at the base.Also on display was the ‘Tetris Mirror’, a piece designed by Giampiero Romano. Perfectly timed to coincide with the release of this Tetris film, the mirror appears to be broken but actually fits together perfectly, offering an unusual take on the looking glass. ‘La Palma’, a new lamp design - and lockdown project - by Dutch duo Kranen/Gille, was a standout too, shaped like a full-size palm tree and unveiled for the very first time at the event.Another favourite was ‘ Window Lamps’ by long-time Seletti collaborator Marcantonio, which look like archetypal windows, complete with white frame and clouds floating in a blue sky, but can be used as a light source for small or dark spaces. Marcantonio’s famed sparrow lights were also fashioned into a newly launched bold, statement chandelier, too. Euronews Culture was also particularly fond of Milanese local Simone Falcetta's ‘Diver Lamps’, which made traditional tattoo art into a 3D piece which is as remarkable as it is practical.All of the pieces from Seletti’s collaborations will go on sale in the autumn.Running alongside the Salone was Euroluce, a premier biennial international lighting exhibition, putting on display the most impressive and of-the-moment lighting from home fixtures to hospital and event installations, with a focus on eco-sustainability and energy saving. Euroluce’s layout was inspired by urban planning, reimagining Milan as a ‘city of light’.A particular light installation intrigued our imagination - namely one from the late minimalist artist Dan Flavin, displayed at the Gallerie d’Italia in central Milan for the Salone. Previously belonging to the iconic Luigi and Peppino Agrati Collection, the three pieces from Flavin’s oeuvre may be called ‘Untitled’ - as all his collections are - but they certainly pack a design punch. Despite their apparent simplicity, each piece modifies the light and colours of the whole environment, often through optical illusion.Unlike much of the Salone, this installation is still available to visit - it will stay on show at the Gallerie D’Italia until 30 June 2023.German luxury brand Montblanc went all in for Design Week, using the opportunity to present their new collection ‘The Library Spirit’ in an aesthetically pleasing, specially built pop up venue in the heart of Milan’s Brera design district, which played host to seemingly endless exhibits.Montblanc’s offering stood out for its pop up, though, offering visitors a chance to use the design house’s iconic pens to send a postcard to friends and family across the world and watch a live calligrapher show off his artistic skills. Also launching their new, more feminine collection of leather bags and accessories, they fully committed to the library theme with bookshelves and large blown up photos of models in library settings. Speaking about the relevance of the inspiration, Marco Tomasetta, Montblanc’s Artistic Director explained, “Libraries are a place for knowledge, intimacy and emotions, where words are there to be discovered for all eternity, expressing the power of their author’s imagination through time. It is a destination that is so authentic to Montblanc, a Maison that has always championed the power of words, and the way they shape our collective cultural identity”.French heavyweight design house Louis Vuitton took over the stunning Palazzo Serbelloni to showcase new projects, including the vast ‘Nomad’, an intricate pavilion designed by New York based MARC FORNES / THEVERYMANY, which almost took over the entire courtyard. Serving as an example of the architect’s signature coral-like designs, the ultra-thin structure is made up of 1,600 uniquely shaped and patterned aluminium sheets, some as thin as 1 millimetre.At Louis Vuitton, that wasn't all. The brand’s ‘Objets Nomades’ furniture and design collection, which was launched in 2012, unveiled 11 new creative and functional items, realised by the likes of Atelier Oï, Raw Edges, Atelier Biagetti and Studio Campana.Vuitton also presented its ‘Cabinet of Curiosities’ collection, created by Marc Newson. For the occasion of the Salone, the Australian designer reinterpreted the brand’s signature monogram trunk, including 19 metal cubes covered in leather in the design, some of which feature secret compartments into the design. Each cube is removable and can be rearranged in more than 1,000 combinations for further customisation - but, if you’re keen to snap one up, be quick as the practical yet ingenious pieces are strictly limited edition.One of the most quirky displays at the Salone came, unsurprisingly, from iconic Italian brand Fornasetti. The design house, perhaps most famous for its ceramics featuring the face of opera singer Lina Cavalieri, unveiled ‘The Syntax of Making’, made up of three new collections of furniture and accessories for the home.The new collections all dipped into themes from Fornasetti’s archive; Giro di Conchiglie features three-dimensional sea-themed images including, of course, shells and a blue-coloured background includes a water-streaking effect, hand-painted by the Atelier's painters. Visitors to the brand’s store were able to see some of the in-house artists working on the painstakingly detailed pieces by hand, which helped to demonstrate how much care and attention goes into each piece.Other collections featured were Giardino Settecentesco - which stands out for its use of vibrant colour and is inspired by natural landscapes and neoclassical style buildings - and the Musciarabia con Rose collection, which plays into the brand’s famous geometry and black lines, adding hand-painted pink flowers which pop on the black and white backgrounds.While a number of the pieces from these new collections are perhaps a little more traditional than usual, Fornasetti hasn’t shied away from its famed quirky style, including in mirrors which feature bubbles made of glass, adding to the unusual nature of the designs.Also on display at Fornasetti were rooms filled with images from their archive, dating back to the foundation of the company in the 1940s, which included silk-screen printing frames used to create their signature black lines.After starting their relationship last year, world renowned French designer Philippe Starck and Dior Maison used Design Week to launch their reinvention of the brand’s iconic Medallion chair, said to be a tribute to the late founder of the fashion house Christian Dior.On display at the stunning 18th Century Palazzo Citterio in central Milan, the Starck-designed chairs and matching and complementary tables and stools were launched alongside a video and musical installation shown to visitors in the round, featuring imagery of toile de Jouy and apparent liquid aluminium, surrounded by plain versions of the Medallion chair which move up and down on strings. The experience, created by Soundwalk Collective, was a fairly trippy, although brief, one and was followed by a quick visit to see Starck’s collection in person.Among numerous designs, including some featuring a boucle fabric and various pieces in Dior’s signature toile de Jouy, was the standout piece - the Monsieur Dior armchair, based on the elegant, oval-backed Medallion chair, a piece associated with the fashion house since 1947.If you’re keen to get your hands on pieces from the Starck collection, it will be rather a long wait though. It isn’t available until next year, when it will go on sale at a selection of Dior boutiques.One of the most impressive installations across all of Design Week, was Grohe’s takeover of Milan's Pinacoteca di Brera museum, where they showcased pieces from their newly revitalised premium sub-brand, Grohe Spa. The German company built an immersive exhibit with a water feature, which took over much of the vast courtyard, reflecting the museum and a statue of Napoleon by Antonio Canova at the centre, creating an optical illusion and playing into the brand’s ‘health through water’ concept.At the four corners of the courtyard were cubes, each offering a multisensory experience to visitors. One showcased the company’s 3D printed metal taps and prototype showerhead - which lessen waste and demonstrate the use of AI technology alongside traditional design and manufacturing. Other cubes showed off the Atrio and Allure Brilliant Private Collections, Grohe’s impressive coloured taps and the brand’s high end shower offerings.The Italian luxury brand’s exhibit at Design Week was a top topic of conversation across Milan, thanks to its fabulous immersive experience. In a collaboration with Italian architect Gaetano Pesce, the fashion house built an entire installation, called ‘Vieni a Vedere’ (Come and See), which welcomed visitors into a ‘grotto’, made using resin and fabric and featuring cave-like paintings. The aim of the display was to present a collection of limited edition handbags designed by Pesce for the brand, which stood out thanks to their unusual designs and sometimes bizarre textures. Talking about the reasoning behind the grotto, Pesce explained that the experience was created to ‘open new ways for design’ and to create a talking point - and the collaboration certainly achieved their goal!",", and of 2023’s Salone - shedding light on sustainable design, innovative materials, urban regeneration and artificial intelligence. Salone Internazionale del Mobile di Milano - is the largest salon of its kind in the world, showcasing the latest and best in furniture, homewares and design.","Back with a bang after the pandemic, Euronews Culture spent Milan Design Week exploring the best of new and innovative design at the iconic Salone and here we share our standouts from the historic event."
SEE,https://www.euronews.com/culture/2023/04/27/international-design-day-interior-trends-to-look-out-for-this-year,International Design Day: Interior trends to look out for this year,,2023-04-28,"International Design Day (IDD) is 60! Today marks six decades since the International Council of Design was founded on 27 April 1963.This year’s theme is ‘Peace. Love. Design!’ and the Council is harking back to its 60s roots. This IDD has a particular focus on the peace sign, designed by British graphic artist Gerald Holtom initially as a logo for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. By the mid-sixties, the CND symbol was used more widely in all protests against war.With this in mind, International Design Day aims to encourage people to think of design’s role in issues facing the world, like war, climate change, economic challenges and political polarisation.While today raises questions of how much design can help to play a positive role in changing the world for the better, Euronews Culture is diving into trends from our visit to Milan Design Week, which ran from 18 - 23 April.Also known as the Salone Internazionale del Mobile di Milano, the world-famous fair is even older than IDD, having taken place for the first time in 1961. This year’s event marked the first full week since the COVID-19 pandemic and was back to its former glory, attracting hundreds of thousands of visitors.It’s the largest fair of its kind in the world, showcasing the latest and best in furniture, homewares and design from across the globe and more than 2,500 companies put their wares on display between the vast Fiera Milano exhibition space as well as in the city centre.Unsurprisingly, artificial intelligencewas a big talking point in Milan, with numerous exhibitors using AI in their creations, often alongside traditional design and manufacturing.German company Grohe’s takeover of Milan's Pinacoteca di Brera museum was one of the Salone’s hottest tickets, where they showcased pieces from their premium sub-brand, Grohe Spa, including new 3D printed metal taps and prototype showerhead. Speaking to Euronews Culture_,_ designers for the brand explained the process takes around 20 hours for each piece, but significantly lessens waste, ensuring that AI technology is environmentally friendly as well as efficient. French designer Audrey Large returned to Milan for her biggest Design Week show to date, putting on display furniture hand-drawn on a tablet and realised using a 3D printer. Large speaks of getting inspiration from digital forms and using her design skills to explore the relationship between the physical and virtual world.A post shared by Audrey Large (@audreylrg)Similarly to Audrey Large, American designer Ryan Decker is influenced by a computer-generated, metaverse-inspired aesthetic and, at the Salone, his show aimed to blur the boundary between digital and physical design. At the off-schedule Alcova exhibition, held in a former abattoir, Decker presented a series of alien-looking lights, which combined flat aluminium sheets, printed with digital 3D renders and AI-generated textures alongside sculptural handmade components.A post shared by ryan decker (@ry.deck)Taking AI several steps further was Australian design house Studio Snoop, who introduced ‘Tilly Talbot’, apparently the ‘world's first AI designer’. While she appeared as a young woman on the brand’s social media, Tilly is in fact a chatbot in the vein of ChatGPT who used Design Week to allow visitors to give feedback and make changes to products from the existing range. Studio Snoop’s founder, Amanda Talbot, explained that she believes it’s important for designers to work with AI rather than rejecting it, saying: “Bringing Tilly to life has brought a new energy and new possibilities into what we design. Rather than shying away from this remarkable technology, I have seen it as a duty for my studio to begin training her with emotional intelligence to give her clear design principles and values that will greatly benefit humankind and nature”. The Studio uses Bauhau-AI, created in-house, and Talbot says it is ""a movement we have created to embody this new-era of designs specialising in combining nature, craft, art, design, and artificial intelligence technology”.A post shared by StudioSnoop (@studiosnoop)Sustainability was also a huge talking point at the Salone. This was to be expected as climate change discussions rage on across the globe. Designers across the event put their wares on show in an attempt to encourage consumers to think in a more environmentally friendly way when it comes to choosing pieces for their own lives and homes.A post shared by Subin Seol (@subin.seol)Korean furniture designer Subin Seol’s collaboration with Retrouvius, who put salvage and vintage pieces back into circulation and uses the slogan ‘re-use is our philosophy’, was a huge hit in Milan. She used handrails from the Fawley Power Station in the south of England and designed and created a dining chair and a coffee table. Seol explained that by embracing the handrails' distinctive and irregular shape, she intended to retain the now demolished building's brutalist aesthetic, while celebrating its heritage and not wasting any salvageable materials. remembering and celebrating the old landmark's heritage.The use of waste materials was prominent across Milan, with designers looking to reduce the environmental impact of their pieces.Euronews Culture spoke to Takeda Katsuya, who runs a design studio in Milan’s Brera District which launched its BRACE collection in collaboration with the Tatehiko factory in the Tochigi Prefecture north of Tokyo. Each piece in the range is made up of light wood and their slimness means they can be shipped worldwide in small packages, lessening emissions and working towards a climate friendly industry.The wood itself is pretty special too and plays into Katsuya’s ethos that nothing should be wasted. Made from Hinoki wood, which is only able to grow in very specific conditions, the factory prides itself on ""using finite resources with utmost care"" and, as a result, the pieces in the BRACE collection are all made using small offcuts from larger furniture pieces.A post shared by Kick Veldman (@kickveldman)Other designers encouraged visitors to the Salone to think more deeply about their consumption of products, with Dutch designer Kick Veldman creating mirrors made from waste aluminium and inviting people to look at their reflections in ‘junk’ created by society.A post shared by PROWL Studio (@prowl__)Similarly, the American PROWL Studio collaborated with M4 Factory, which specialises in regenerative plastic goods, to create the PEEL chair, while tackling the issue of so-called fast furniture. It’s a reimagining of the hugely familiar plastic stacking chair, but, instead, made from sustainable hemp bast fibre, a byproduct of hemp and cannabis processing that typically goes to waste. The collaboration put the chair on show in various stages of decomposition, challenging visitors to think about the end of a product’s life cycle at the point of purchase.The conversation at Milan Design Week was also surrounding the sustainability not just of the pieces produced, but also the event itself.While any show on its scale will no doubt have a significant environmental impact, the Salone organises have continually stepped up their commitment to improving sustainability in recent years. They’ve signed up to the UN Global Compact corporate’s sustainability pledge for 2023 and also updated voluntary guidelines for exhibitors, while working towards collaborating with more organisations committed to caring for the planet.With a focus on sustainability, it will come as no surprise that many designers at the Salone took inspiration from the natural world in their offerings.Forma Rosa Studio presented their first solo show ‘Natura Oscura’ at the Alcova venue, explaining that they aimed to display “elements of man-made infrastructure… juxtaposed with nature's greenery growth, creating and reimagining our relationship with the world around us”.Their collection was inspired by the post-pandemic world, where humans have become more isolated from nature, and took inspiration from natural phenomena, including from a fractal growth called ‘Botryoidal’ that inspired their Botryoidal Lamps.A post shared by Forma Rosa Studio (@formarosastudio)Forma Rosa also used AI alongside traditional pottery techniques for their ceramic offerings, using an algorithm to generate shapes of stools and lights before putting finishing touches to each piece by hand.French fashion powerhouse Louis Vuitton took over the stunning Palazzo Serbelloni to showcase its new projects, including a collaboration with New York based MARC FORNES / THEVERYMANY. Called ‘Nomad’, the team produced a vast and intricate pavilion designed and served as an example of the architect’s signature coral-like designs. The ultra-thin structure is made up of 1,600 uniquely shaped and patterned aluminium sheets, some as thin as 1 millimetre, and Louis Vuitton explained its ties to the natural world, saying it resembles “a living being that has organically bubbled up from the Palazzo's courtyard"".Atelier LUMA, part of France’s cultural centre LUMA Arles, brought its work exploring bioregional design practices in the South of France and beyond to Design Week.Every piece on show was inspired by nature across the south of France, the Mediterranean basin and beyond and used a combination of human resources and sustainable and easily available natural materials.At the Salone, LUMA displayed five large installations, all of which offered sensory experiences rooted in specific natural settings. The team used rice straw, salt, local fabrics and wool, giving visitors a chance to see for themselves the bioregion surrounding Arles, through sound, light, colours, patterns and textures.A post shared by LUMA Arles (@luma_arles)They also transformed algae and agricultural by-products into bioplastic seats and used traditionally Middle Eastern materials like palm leaves to put a new spin on regular furniture designs. As well as being inspired by nature and using it for their creations, LUMA also salvaged construction materials and upholstery fabrics, to name just a couple of materials, to make their collection which took Alcova by storm.Ignoring a potential global recession, one huge trend - which will likely never go away on Italian soil - was maximalism.A post shared by ARICÒ ® (@antonioarico)Dolce and Gabbana led the pack, following its splashy Casa homewares line two years ago. The fashion house collaborated with 10 up-and-coming designers for the Salone, from Murano glass artists to wicker makers from Sicily. While it was a huge celebration of Italian design and craftsmanship, none of it - unsurprisingly - was subtle. The standout? Probably the unmissable installation by Antonio Aricò which took over the top floor of Dolce and Gabbana Casa’s Via Broggi boutique. It was inspired by a limonaia - or lemon greenhouse - and everything was in a stinging yellow tone and inspired by classical antiquity. This being Dolce and Gabbana, the collaboration went one step further and even included embellished brooms to sweep away leaves that dropped from surrounding trees - in chartreuse, of course.Italian design house Fornasetti has packed a maximalist punch since its foundation in the 1940s and its 2023 Salone launch didn’t disappoint.The brand unveiled three new collections, all dipping into themes from their remarkable, stand out archive. ‘Giro di Conchiglie’ features three-dimensional sea-themed images including, of course, shells and a blue-coloured background including a hand painted water-streaking effect. ‘Giardino Settecentesco’ uses vibrant colour and a new take on toile du Jouy, inspired by the meeting place of natural landscapes and neoclassical style buildings and the ‘Musciarabia con Rose’ collection plays into the brand’s famous geometry and black lines, making it pop further with the addition of hand painted pink flowers.Visitors to the installation at Fornasetti’s flagship store were also able to see pieces from the archive, including its vast, iconic collection of ceramics featuring the face of opera singer Lina Cavalieri. They really are the definition of maximalism.A post shared by ℒa DoubleJ (@ladoublej)This being Milan, there was no escaping the trend - and La DoubleJ made sure of that. The Milan-based clothing and homewares brand used the Salone to launch their expansion into wallpaper and did it in spectacular style. Founder JJ Martin gave a maximalist makeover to the bathrooms of eight of her favourite spots across the city including eateries like Pasticcerias Cucci and Cova, the Apophis Club and, of course, the La DoubleJ flagship store on the exclusive Via Sant Andrea. All of the prints packed an enormous punch and certainly gave visitors to these WCs something to look at - and talk about.Fashion collided with interior design at the Salone and, while fashion houses from across the globe have long been present as Design Week, since furniture sales were sent skyrocketing by the pandemic, many more clothing designers have wisely chosen to take advantage of the boom and take part in the event. There were so many in residence that we can only bring you some of the highlights - but expect to see interior design and fashion getting more intertwined as the year continues.Joining long-established exhibitors like Louis Vuitton and Armani Casa, Bottega Veneta made its debut at the Salone in spectacular style. The Italian brand closed its entire Montenapoleone boutique for the occasion, transforming it into an immersive experience, which welcomed visitors into a ‘grotto’, made using resin and fabric and featuring cave-like paintings. The fashion house collaborated with Italian architect Gaetano Pesce for the display, called ‘Vieni a Vedere’ ('Come and See') and put on show a collection of limited edition handbags designed by Pesce for the brand. The installation was a huge talking piece and the bags themselves stood out due to their unusual designs and unusual textures. Pesce explained that the collaboration was started with the purpose of ‘opening new ways for design’ and it was certainly a success for Bottega’s first time at the event.Dior is arguably one of the most famous design houses in the world and the French brand launched their reinvention of the brand’s iconic Medallion chair, said to be a tribute to the late founder of the fashion house Christian Dior, in collaboration with world renowned French designer Philippe Starck at this year’s Salone. The collection was shown at the stunning 18th Century Palazzo Citterio in central Milan, and featured Dior’s signature toile de Jouy fabric on various chairs, as well as matching and complementary tables and stools. The Monsieur Dior armchair tribute was the standout piece - based on the elegant, oval-backed Medallion chair, a piece associated with the fashion house since 1947.Jimmy Choo is best known for its shoes - made iconic across film and television - so it makes sense that the atelier would seek to extend its reach in design, and it did just that at the Salone. Collaborating with Venetian glassmaker Venini to create a limited series of vases in four different shades, the two design teams incorporated Choo’s iconic diamond motif, more commonly found in the soles of their shoes. A spokesperson for Jimmy Choo told Euronews Culture at the installation at their Via Sant Andrea flagship store, that they think of their stiletto designs as sculpture in their own right, so teaming up with Venini made perfect sense.A post shared by Jimmy Choo (@jimmychoo)As so many trends emerged from Design Week, we thought we’d give you a bonus one to add to the list…Bouclé was everywhere. The fabric most often used in clothing - see Chanel’s iconic jackets, to name just one example - adorned countless designs across Milan. Unsurprisingly used by fashion designers in their collaborations, Phillipe Starck used it in his reinvention of Dior’s Medallion chair, Elie Saab adorned sofas and bed frames with the woven fabric, and Diesel Living’ collaboration with Moroso turned it red and used it throughout their collection.Expect to see Bouclé’s reign as a favourite fabric of those looking to add classic elegance to their style - and now homes - continue throughout the year.","the first time in 1961.IDD is 60!

TOUCH,https://www.euronews.com/culture/2023/04/26/designers-and-their-homes-matilde-mourinhos-london-town-house,Designers and their homes - Matilde Mourinho's London town house,Saskia O'Donoghue,2023-04-26,"Matilde Mourinho may be the daughter of legendary football manager Jose, but she’s making a name for herself, having founded MATILDE Jewellery, a sustainable fine jewellery brand which launched in December 2020.The decor throughout her townhouse in London’s exclusive Chelsea Harbour was hugely inspired by her work. Designed in collaboration with Threads Interiors, the newly established service from the Threads Styling, a personalised luxury shopping and styling service, Matilde will celebrate a year in her property in May.She launched her brand MATILDE during the pandemic and working from home meant that she knew her next dwelling had to be appropriate for serious quiet contemplation and also leisure. “I really had to keep in mind that this would be a space to relax as much it was going to be a space to work, and I wanted to achieve a balance of those two things,” she tells Euronews Culture.Matilde explains how the colour palette in her home is “quite neutral and really takes inspiration from natural elements and shapes, things that heavily inspire the jewellery I create. So many pieces like the dining table, the shelf, the wavy mirrors – I really love their shape and how imperfect they are – you will see very few sharp and straight edges around the house and more fluid and organic shapes”.She was also inspired by her mother’s interior style. As her family moved around a lot when she was younger her mother always made sure that every place they lived felt like home, regardless of how long they lived there.Although she only moved into the house last year, it was built in 1986 and, while Matilde says it was already an amazing property, she owes a lot of the interior design to her mother, Matilde Faria, calling her “the brains behind the operation”, adding “I trust her taste more than anyone’s… I think that makes it that much more special because it was a project that she played such a big role in and she couldn’t have done it better”.Matilde says creating a homely feel was crucial during the interior design process of her impressive house, but she made sure it wasn’t too stuffy or traditional either. She says she took inspiration from “natural elements and shapes for the décor, just a space that felt relaxing and easy to be in”, adding, “I also am 26 and I wanted part of the house to be a bit more ‘fun’ and young, so my studio on the top floor is where that comes in. It’s both my office as well as a lounge area, and it has more colour and more fun elements to it like a neon sign that says ‘Matilde Jewellery’ which is on the wall behind my desk, and the iconic Ultrafragola Mirror [designed by Ettore Sottsass]”.Talking about her favourite areas and pieces in the house, Matilde cites the mirror as well as the Alpha Sofa from French interior and furniture designer Pierre Paulin, explaining, “I think a good sofa really makes a house a home. This is where I have friends and family over, where I do my movie nights, and what I spend my Sundays on but of course, I am absolutely terrified of anyone sitting on it because it’s so white and perfect that I won’t risk anyone ruining it!”She says that her home is a real reflection of her personality and style and that everyone who comes to visit comments that it is ‘so her’ - but, Matilde laughs, they complain about the number of stairs!Although Matilde’s house is an exceptionally impressive space, she has advice for anyone inspired by it looking to achieve a similar aesthetic, saying, “I would say just have fun with it. Go for the pieces that you are drawn to and that call you, in the end it’s your space so it must feel right for you”.Her top piece of advice though? Use Pinterest as a resource. Matilde says, “Just gather images and references of things that you’re drawn to and very quickly you will start to see it come together and that will help define your style”.You can learn more about Matilde and her jewellery company at matildejewellery.com","made sure every place they lived felt like home, regardless of how long they lived there. she launched MATILDE Jewellery, a sustainable fine jewellery brand which launched in December 2020.

Whenever there’s an opportunity to do something the highest, the fastest or the smallest, a cohort of ambitious people will always come running. It’s no surprise then that building the world’s tallest building has routinely fascinated engineers for centuries.On this day in 1913, a new world’s tallest building was opened. The Woolworth Building in Manhattan, New York is 241m tall. At the time of its construction, the next closest building was the Metropolitan Life Tower, also in Manhattan and standing at an imposing 213m high.Height has always been a way of showing off a building’s credentials. Cultures have always shown what’s important to them through their tallest buildings. It’s why all the way up to the 20th century were all religious monuments, from the ziggurats of ancient Mesopotamia to the churches of Europe.Coming into the 20th century, the importance of religion was fading. In many ways, the growth of skyscrapers as humanity’s tallest buildings encapsulates a cultural shift from valuing religion above all to economic interests.In 1890 Ulm Minster in Germany was the tallest building worldwide at 161m. Technically it wasn’t the tallest structure in the world though as the Eiffel Tower, opened in 1889 stood an astonishing 330 m high. The winds of culture had changed and Ulm Minster is the last time a church was the tallest building in the world.The era of skyscrapers at the top of the tables begins with the Philadelphia City Hall. Completed in 1894, the peak of its tower was 167 m high.Then, in 1908, the Singer Building was completed in Manhattan. At 192 m tall, it became the new tallest building in the world. The Singer Building began a trend of Manhattan skyscrapers trying to outdo each other across the 20th century.In 1909, the Metropolitan Life Tower was completed. Its record stood for four years before the Woolworth Building opened. Then, in 1930, 40 Wall Street took the title. That barely lasted a year before the Chrysler Building was completed, trouncing the previous record by 25 m.The Chrysler Building couldn’t celebrate long. One year later, in 1931, the Empire State Building took the record again. At 381 m tall, it would hold the record for 40 years before the 1 World Trade Center, known as the first tower of the Twin Towers, was completed in 1970 to a height of 417 m.The Twin Towers were the last New York buildings to hold the record. In 1973, Chicago’s Sears Tower took the record for 25 years, before it passed outside of North America for good.While the 20th century’s tallest buildings were defined by the Americans, it was Asia’s turn to start outdoing each other’s skyscrapers in the 21st century. First with the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur in 1998, then Taipei 101 in 2004.Finally, the tallest building since 2010 has been Dubai’s Burj Khalifa. Taller than Taipei 101 by an amount greater than the entire Woolworth building itself, it is a staggering 828 m tall.","a new world’s tallest building is opened. The Woolworth Building in Manhattan, New York is 241m tall. at the time of its construction, the next closest building was the Metropolitan Life Tower.","Before the 20th century, the tallest buildings were invariably churches and other religious sites. At the turn of the century that all changed with the birth of the skyscraper."

The iconic Italian brand founded in the 1940s, famous for its ceramics with opera singer Lina Cavalieri's face, is unveiling its new collection. ‘The Syntax of Making' is Fornasetti's three new collections of furniture and accessories for the home characterised by new decorations that speak for the brand’s quirky design look.The new collections all dip into themes from the brand's archive. Giro di Conchiglie features three-dimensional sea-themed images including, of course, shells and a blue-coloured background with a hand-painted water-streaking effect.Giardino Settecentesco stands out for its use of vibrant colour and is inspired by natural landscapes and neoclassical style buildings while the Musciarabia con Rose collection plays into the brand’s famous geometry and black lines, adding hand-painted pink flowers which pop on the monochromatic backgrounds.Across the three collections are various pieces of furniture and accessories for the home, including wooden cabinets, bedside tables, trays, mirrors, lamps and, of course, porcelain.Fornasetti tells Euronews Culture that their work is so distinctive that owners only need to have a few pieces in order to, “transform any corner of the home into a microcosm of personality and elegance”.The Italian design house is also offering more compact and functional pieces this Salone, including smaller cabinets and bedside tables and console tables which have sharper lines and drawers for adding storage without, Fornasetti says, “sacrificing their elegance”.While a number of the pieces from this collection are perhaps a little more traditional than usual, Fornasetti hasn’t shied away from its famed quirky style, with mirrors in an unusual curved shape - with some featuring a unique design with nine glass bubbles in a mirror - and trays which look like artists’ canvases.Fornasetti explains that it’s crucial for them as a design house to maintain their slow production process to add to the quality of each piece and to pay homage to their Italian heritage, referencing the themes in the Syntax of Making.Barnaba Fornasetti, the brand's artistic director, told press why it’s so important to maintain the same processes they've relied upon for 80 years, saying, ""The value of making things by hand has acquired a deep meaning for me over time. It goes beyond technique and the desire to preserve a firm and coherent identity. It is a choice and a way of being today, in our modern world, an ethical line that puts people and what they make at the centre of everything,” adding, “Craftsmanship is a conscious way of working, fuelled by a dynamic creativity, which embodies the extraordinary capacity to continuously combine abstract knowledge and experience, what I like to call 'thinking with the hands'”.Fornasetti told us that they employ six painters for their furniture and 16 for their small ceramic pieces. It's a local affair, as well as a small one with the workshop based in Milan itself.To demonstrate how much care the brand take with their pieces, visitors to the installation won’t just be able to see the new collection, but also the process behind it, with live painting by the atelier's painters in the store and rooms filled with images from their archive, like silk-screen printing frames used to create their signature black lines.Fornasetti’s offering for the Salone is on display at their store on Corso Venezia in Milan until 23 April.","the brand founded in the 1940s, famous for its ceramics with opera singer Lina Cavalieri's face.

For the 2023 event, the Italian design house is opening its doors to present its first ever outdoor collection for Armani/Casa furniture and furnishings.The headquarters of the Giorgio Armani brand is usually closed to the public, but they’re welcoming guests inside for Milan Design Week at the stunning Palazzo Orsini to celebrate the launch.The new pieces are on display in both the Palazzo’s gardens and fresco rooms that are usually reserved for Haute Couture clients.In a garden to the back of the 17th century building, various pieces from the first Armani/Casa collection entirely dedicated to outdoor use are on show - including sun loungers, sofas, tables and ornaments with cactus and lotus flower theming.Displayed with the sound of trickling water from a fountain under spring green trees, much of the furniture appears to be weaved - in typical Armani style - and the accompanying fabrics and upholstery are in hues familiar to connoisseurs of the brand or printed in their signature palm motifs. It’s all built for outdoor use and appears sturdy as well as stylish.Continuing on the tour of the Palazzo, guests can access rooms on the first floor, with more outdoor furniture - which works for indoor spaces - to see.There are pieces strictly for inside use too, including a number that an Armani/Casa representative told Euronews Culture have been crafted with the same artisanal workmanship as an Armani Haute Couture creation.The mother-of-pearl chair, dressing table and desk are particularly impressive, all hand-crafted in Italy and using tiles in a mosaic pattern, playing into the familiar Armani woven look.There are, unsurprisingly, strong Italian influences throughout, especially in the Murano glass branded vases and ceramic trinkets, inspired by the vegetation found throughout the Mediterranean landscape.A personal favourite were the Tarot cards - a somewhat unusual find, but one which plays into Armani/Casa’s playful aesthetic. They are, of course, branded too.A word of warning - this rare opportunity to visit the Palazzo Orsini is unsurprisingly extremely popular and queues can be long. It is absolutely worth the wait but, if you have too much on your plate this design week to add in a visit, here’s the good news - much of the new collection is on display in the Armani/Casa shop windows on Corso Venezia in the city as well.Palazzo Orsini is on Via Borgonuovo in Milan and the Armani/Casa installation is open from 18 - 23 April.",",,,,,,, is opening its doors to present its first ever outdoor collection for Armani/Casa furniture and furnishings.

Miss Dior and Monsieur Dior, Catherine and Christian Dior, the sister and the brother, the chair and the armchair, is the story of a sublime complementary duality"".The Starck-designed chairs are accompanied at the impressive display at the 18th Century Palazzo Citterio in the centre of Milan - as part of Fuorisalone, the satellite show of the main Salone fair based across the city - with matching and complementary tables and stools.The designer has used aluminium throughout his designs and the manufacturing process, speaking of his fondness for its simplicity and durability, explaining, “aluminium is the point zero from which everything is built, the idea of intelligence and purity of technology. The object as it is in its origin, its essence, without any dross”.While aluminium might be simplicity to its core, the display at Palazzo Citterio is anything but. Guests are made to wait in the building’s stunning courtyard before being ushered - literally, there are men wearing branded Dior t-shirts acting as cinema-style ushers shining torches at the floor - into an auditorium. There, visitors are shown a video and musical installation in the round, with toile de Jouy and apparent liquid aluminium on display, surrounded by plain versions of the Medallion chair which move up and down on strings. A post shared by Dior Official (@dior)The experience, created by Soundwalk Collective, is a fairly trippy one although brief and is followed by a quick visit to see Starck’s collection in person before Dior personnel rush you out into the daylight to sit at tables flanked by toile de Jouy printed umbrellas.If you’re keen to get your hands on pieces from the collection, it will be rather a long wait - it isn’t available until next year, when it will go on sale at a selection of Dior boutiques.In Euronews Culture's experience, this is an extremely popular event at Milan Design week so booking ahead is advised to avoid long queues.

Each item is topped with a light, removable tray and can allow for different configurations and applications, adding to its versatility.Euronews Culture met Takeda Katsuya at his design house as part of Fuorisalone, the satellite show of the main Salone fair spread across Milan. The BRACE collection, designed by Katsuya's team and manufactured by Takehito, is also a display of cultural fusion between Italian and Japanese design and is very much a family - and friends - affair.Katsuya and his wife, the artist and painter Iida Takako, met while studying in Florence and she lives between Milan and Ashikaga, keeping in constant contact with her husband on behalf of the Takehito design house and factory in Japan. The couple are great friends with the creative minds behind Tatehiko, which has been in existence since 1892 in the Tochigi Prefecture north of Tokyo.Katsuya explains that the factory - which employs just 20 craftspeople - makes use of traditional techniques, passed down over the generations since the company’s founding. Each piece is handmade and the philosophy behind the company is that nothing is wasted; Katsuya tells Euronews the factory prides themselves on ""using finite resources with utmost care"". As a result, the pieces in the BRACE collection are all small offcuts from larger furniture designs which use Hinoki wood from the Tochigi forest.The wood has been used in the construction and furniture industries in Japan for centuries and is famous, despite its light weight, for its resistance, flexibility and deceptive strength. It’s considered a very precious material as Hinoki can only be grown in very specific environmental atmospheres, like the Tochigi forest, which has low winter temperatures, little snowfall and rich soils which are nurtured by moderate temperatures and rainfall. The forest offers an ideal environment for Hinoki cypress growth and makes wood from there especially prized.The Tochigi forest also inspires the joints used to hold the BRACE collection together. Inspired by the shoots that grow from the ground, they’re made using a traditional Japanese architectural technique called Shiguchi which uses steel to provide strength despite the slim structures.Katsuya explains that their slimness means they can be shipped worldwide in small packages, lessening emissions and working towards a climate friendly industry.While the pieces in the collection are very much Japanese at their core, their simplicity and neutral colours mean they fit in well with bolder Italian design.The Takeda Katsuya Design studio also plays host this Salone to more Japanese-Italian fusion pieces, including those made by master shoemaker Fukaya Hidetaka, who uses offcuts of Italian leather from his larger creations to make furniture like chaise longues and flower vases.The BRACE collection can be viewed at the Takeda Katsuya Design studio at Via del Torchio from 18 - 23 April.","is a collaboration between Takeda Katsuya Design studio and woodworking masters Tatehiko.

Euronews Culture is at the Milan Furniture Fair - or Salone Internazionale del Mobile di Milano - all week, for its 61st edition.The Design Week, also referred to as Salone, is the largest fair of its kind in the world, showcasing the latest and best in furniture, homeware and design from across the globe. Taking place at the enormous Fiera Milano event space, over 2,500 companies are displaying their products.Running from 18 to 23 April, and attracting hundreds of thousands of visitors, we’ll be bringing you all the highlights from this huge event with a focus on new trends in design, stand out pieces and talents to look out for.First of all, let's showcase one of the most impressive designer of the fair... Seletti. The Italian brand may be almost 60 years old - founded in 1964 - but it’s still profoundly modern. As part of Design Week, the brand, known globally for its surrealist designs like its iconic lipstick mirrors, has created an immersive experience for visitors at its flagship store on Corso Garibaldi in the city centre of Milan.It’s certainly a spectacle - a giant pair of legs heralds your entrance, complete with Seletti-branded plaster and a huge cat with a heart shaped bottom which doubles as an impressive lamp and charger.Walking through the building, you’ll see many of Seletti’s iconic collaborations, including the famous TOILETPAPER designs, which include the lipstick mirror, Classics on Acid by Diesel Living and Antonia Arico’s Magna Graecia collection, a take on ancient Roman and Greek ceramics with a modern twist.However, it’s the courtyard garden to the back of the space which is the real star of this particular show. Dotted around are multiple monster-covered boxes designed by artist Gianpiero D’Alessandro, who has collaborated with Justin Bieber and Snoop Dogg among others. Inside these boxes are the new launches for Seletti from a number of established and up-and-coming homeware designers.Long-time Seletti collaborator Marcantonio has a stand out piece on display inside the boxes - his Window Lamps. The archetypal windows, complete with white frame and clouds floating in a blue sky and surrounded by sparrow lights, have been formed into a bold chandelier.Also inside a box is La Palma, a new lamp design by Dutch duo Kranen/Gille. Jos Kranen told Euronews that the lamp was ""a lockdown project"" used to pass the time during the COVID-19 pandemic. The impressive light, shaped like a full-size palm tree, has never been seen before and, while it's currently for indoor use only, Kranen says they're planning to make it work for outdoors too with adjustments to the metal fabric and wiring. That's one way to shake up an urban garden look. Dutch designer Tomas Schats is also featured at the Seletti showcase, with his On-Off lamps on display. He's an artist who puts illustrations into 3D, with an aim to ""mislead the viewer in a subtle manner"", as is the case with these house-shaped lights. To add to the quirkiness, the chimneys of the houses act as on/off switches to make a functional and whimsical design.Perfectly timed to coincide with the release of this Tetris film, also on show at Seletti is the Tetris Mirror, a mirror designed by Giampiero Romano. Displayed on a background of the popular computer game, the mirror appears to be broken but actually fits together perfectly, offering an unusual take on the looking glass.One of the most engaging set-ups at the Seletti showroom is the circus, featuring lamps by Uto Balmoral, who keeps his real identity a secret. Each piece consists of an asymmetrical striped circus tent lampshade with a circus-themed figures, like a strongman and a burlesque dancer, at the base. Seletti says more lamp base figures will become available as their collaboration continues.Perhaps best known as a tattoo artist, Milanese local Simone Falcetta's approach to his collaboration with Seletti was bound to be a quirky one. With his Diver Lamps, the designer has created two varieties of traditional tattoo art with the vintage diver image, but made them into a 3D piece which is as remarkable as it is practical. They'll go on sale - along with all the other pieces mentioned here - via Seletti in the autumn.The showroom on Corso Garibaldi is open to visitors to Milan Design Week until Sunday, 23 April.","is the biggest fashion fair in the world, showcasing the latest and best in furniture, homeware and design.

As Germans from either side of Berlin tore down the physical and figurative barrier erected by decades of the Cold War, it ushered in a new promised era for Europe.The reunification of East and West Germany was celebrated in a ceremony at the Reichstag, the parliamentary building in Berlin. The building had been the home of previous German governments, including the imperial era and the Nazi regime.Severe fighting during the Second World War put the building in ruins. It was restored in the 70s but couldn’t be used for either German governments as it was outside of the two countries’ borders.In 1991, after the two sides of Germany were reunified, it was decided Berlin would remain the nation’s capital with the Bundestag using the Reichstag as its primary building. To celebrate, reconstruction was in order, and that task was given to the iconic British architect Norman Foster in 1994.Known for his grand glass-based modern innovations, Foster’s architectural firm had designed the eye-catching HSBC Main Building in Hong Kong, alongside many other significant buildings. For the Reichstag, the interior was renovated to bring it up-to-date with the demands of government functions going into the 21st century.Most notable though was Foster’s addition of a glass dome to the top of the Reichstag. Echoing the original design of the building before the damage of the Second World War, the cupola was the suggestion of Gottfried Böhm and voted in by the Bundestag, against Foster’s original and more expensive idea of creating a parasol-like building.Providing a 360° view of Berlin, the glass dome symbolises the reunification as well as the shedding of past national traumas. Thanks to the redesign, the Reichstag is one of the most popular landmarks in Germany, as the second most visited attraction in the country.It opened on this day in 1999.Other Norman Foster city designsBeyond recreating Berlin’s Reichstag, Foster has had a powerful effect on many skylines across the world. His reputation from buildings like the Reichstag has put him first in line for many similar projects aimed at rejuvenating traditional settings.LondonIn Foster’s homeland, the capital’s skyline owes a lot to the architect. Opening just over three years after the new Reichstag building was Foster’s City Hall. Featuring some cross-over design features of the Reichstag, the new building was designed to hold the Greater London Authority.Walking distance from City Hall’s southbank location is also Foster’s Millennium Bridge. The newest addition to the bridges over London’s Thames River, it gained the unfortunate nickname “The Wobbly Bridge” after initial faults caused it to sway when people walked over it.Other major additions include multiple buildings in Canary Wharf and the redesign of Wembley Stadium, the UK’s largest stadium.AstanaFoster’s work has travelled far and wide. From Singapore to California, it’s hard to find a major city that doesn’t have at least one design from the legendary architect. But few cities have felt the Foster fingerprint more notably than the capital of Kazakhstan.When Astana was named Kazakhstan’s capital in 1997, urban planners were brought in to design a city worthy of the capital title. The entire city was redeveloped and Foster’s designs are an integral part of its modern look.The country’s congress hall, the Palace of Peace and Reconciliation was Foster’s first commission. He designed an imposing futuristic pyramid building that can be lit up depending on the occasion.Taking influence from the country’s nomadic roots, Foster also designed the Khan Shatyr Entertainment Center. A neo-futurist building, its fabric roof makes it the largest tent in the world.",", the Reichstag is one of the most visited attractions in the country. Norman Foster changed Berlin’s parliament building in 1989. Foster’s glass-based modern innovations have influenced many skylines across the world.","On this day, the newly designed Reichstag was opened in Berlin in 1999. Behind it was the architect who's designed the look of multiple modern cities."

Since then, it has grown massively. The current show occupies an area of nearly 230,000 square metres and hosts around 2,500 companies putting their wares on display, in the centre itself and across the city. Pre-Covid around half a million people from all over the world visited the fair annually and it’s expected to be back to that level this year.2023’s theme will shed light on the themes of sustainable design, innovative materials, urban regeneration and artificial intelligence as a tool to sit side-by-side with man-made design, rather than replace it.Running alongside the Design Week is Euroluce, a premier biennial international lighting exhibition that will put on display the most impressive and of-the-moment lighting from home fixtures to hospital and event installations, with a focus on eco-sustainability and energy saving. Euroluce’s layout will be inspired by urban planning to reimagine it as a ‘city of light’.Here’s a guide of some of the highlights set to go on display at 2023’s Salone Internazionale del Mobile di Milano.Fornasetti, the iconic brand founded in the 1940s and perhaps most famous for its ceramics featuring the face of opera singer Lina Cavalieri, will unveil ‘The Syntax of Making’.

Jimmy Choo’s stiletto shoes are thought of as sculpture in their own right, so teaming up with Venetian glassmaker Venini to create a limited series of vases in four different shades makes perfect sense. The glass creations mirror Jimmy Choo’s signature Diamond chain, currently featuring across the brand’s latest shoe, handbag and jewellery designs. You can catch the vases on display in the window of Jimmy Choo’s Milan flagship boutique, located on Via Sant Andrea.This year’s Salone will put on display a collaboration and cultural fusion between Takeda Katsuya Design studio, based in Milan, and Tatehiko, based in the Japanese city of Ashikaga.

Zambaiti Parati has been a top name in wallpaper design since the 1970s and has collaborated for the Salone with the Metrogramma studio by Andrea Boschetti and AMDL CIRCLE by Michele De Lucchi. The result is the new ‘Atelis’ collection, which features a collection of wallpapers using rice starch and pure linens, with slight flaws showing the value of handmade decor. Metrogramma’s input is a design theme of the history of stitching, recalling the ancient art of sewing and creating precious artisanal and decorative wallpapers. AMDL CIRCLE’s pieces were inspired by the rural landscape, focusing on the technique of ploughing and, as a result, raking pigments onto sheets of wallpaper with wooden combs, evoking the look of field furrows as seen from the sky. They used natural, earthy colours and left small imperfections in each piece, adding uniqueness to every design.TheSaloneis open to the public from 18 - 23 April.",",,, furniture and accessories for the home, including wooden cabinets, bedside tables, trays, mirrors, lamps and porcelain.
