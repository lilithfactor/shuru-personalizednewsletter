The institute will function as both a scientific research center and a tourist destination. It will accelerate conservation-driven research, while offering visitors truly multidimensional experiences that bridge educational exhibitions with adventure-filled excursions.""We wanted to design a first-of-its-kind facility that extends far beyond any existing marine life attraction,"" commented John Pagano, Group CEO of TRSDC. ""With 10 zones that provide everything from augmented reality experiences to night diving, and spaces for the scientific community to effectively progress their environmental projects, the facility is undeniably unique. Not only will it drive global green and blue innovations, it will also help put Saudi Arabia on the map for travelers seeking trips that enrich their lives.""The institute will live in the Triple Bay marina at AMAALA, but is the beating heart of our broader ambitions to protect and enhance the thriving Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia. Through our expanding portfolio of projects, we will share our valuable scientific discoveries with the world and enable our guests to experience the true beauty of our thriving coral reefs.""Expected to host up to 650 people at any one time, guests will be able to walk underwater, snorkel with rare species, participate in lab tours and dive the depths of the Red Sea in a submarine. A testament to TRSDC's coral farming operations, the facility will also be home to one of the world's largest man-made reefs, measuring an astonishing 40 meters long and 10 meters deep and providing an epic ""Grand Reveal"" moment for visitors on arrival.Set within the AMAALA destination on the west coast of Saudi Arabia and located on the waterfront of Triple Bay, the 10,340 square meter institute will comprise three levels - one above ground and two below - and offer stunning panoramic views of the Red Sea and the marina.Inspired by the Red Sea's thriving coral formations, the glass-reinforced concrete that is being used to build the institute will be intricately molded to resemble reef patterns against the skyline. Inside, exhibition displays have also been integrated into the infrastructure, with visitors flanked by suspended semi-spherical tanks containing colorful local marine wildlife from the point of entry.""The marine life institute will take guests on a vibrant, educational, and awe-inspiring journey that unveils the natural wonders of the Red Sea and blurs the boundaries between the institute and the ocean,"" said Gerard Evenden, Head of Studio at Foster + Partners.

"Graypants has unveiled Barro, a pendant fixture designed by Caterina Moretti. Barro is made from clay pulled directly from the earth of Oaxaca, handcrafted, and colored with only the power of heat and smoke.",https://www.dexigner.com/news/33939,Barro by Caterina Moretti for Graypants,2022-09-26,"Graypants has unveiled Barro, a pendant fixture designed by Caterina Moretti. Barro is made from clay pulled directly from the earth of Oaxaca, handcrafted, and colored with only the power of heat and smoke.The Barro pendant lamps represent the conjunction of craft and innovation, using traditional techniques to create a modern, unique shape. Incredibly versatile, Barro integrates easily to elevate its surroundings - over a dining table or kitchen island, dotted over a bar in a restaurant, or welcoming you in a lobby space.Barro is created using an ancient, region-specific process. It begins with gathering earth from the surrounding areas to make the clay. Water is added to slake the clay and create slip, which is then poured into handmade plaster molds. The clay pieces are each hand burnished before firing with the help of a smooth stone, to achieve an iridescent color and smooth feel.Once the pieces are ready to be fired, they are placed in a special two-vent kiln and stoked continuously for nine hours. Here, a process known as reduction of atmosphere takes place: during firing, at a specific moment, the vents are closed to reduce oxygen, generating a chemical reaction that infuses a deep black color in the natural color of the clay, creating the Charcoal Clay finish. The clay technique dates back to pre-Hispanic times in Mexico and tells the story of the empirical knowledge of those who came before, and their journey exploring and communicating with nature. The Natural Clay finish is created using the same technique, only it is fired for a shorter time and the oxygen reduction technique is not applied.Caterina chose to work with local artisan Amando Pedro in the production of the pendants because of his high level of expertise, and his sensitivity to using traditional techniques to achieve modern, unexpected shapes. In creating the pendant, Caterina took into account the history it can show, paying tribute to the Oaxaca black clay tradition in San Bartolo Coyotepec, while also imprinting it with a distinct style, expertise and contemporary vision.Photography: Adam Joseph Wells","Bartolo Coyotepec has unveiled a pendant fixture designed by Caterina Moretti.

Blond recently collaborated with zero waste grocery service Dizzie to launch its reusable fossil-fuel-free packaging.,https://www.dexigner.com/news/33937,Blond Designs Reusable Fossil-fuel Free Packaging for Dizzie,2022-09-25,"Blond recently collaborated with zero waste grocery service Dizzie to launch its reusable fossil-fuel-free packaging. The redesign will reduce the carbon footprint of Dizzie's brand and help cut 114 billion pieces of plastic from supermarket shelves.Blond created reusable and refillable packaging that is both long-lasting and 100% recyclable at the end of its life cycle. Consumers can buy their essentials without any packaging waste by using the reusable pots. They then can be decanted, stored and later collected and washed by Dizzie.Looking at the principles of the circular economy, Blond carried out holistic research into the packaging landscape and worked with Dizzie to design a packaging system that would ultimately save warehouse space and reduce the carbon footprint of deliveries.Blond designed the packaging using a biocomposite made from wood fibres (a by-product of the forest industry) and bio-PP (made from waste and residue oils). This means that Dizzie pots are made from 98% renewable materials. They are designed to stand up to 200 cycles of reuse, and all parts are 100% recyclable. When they finally reach the end of life, they are sent back to the manufacturer to be broken down into the raw material to remake the pots, facilitating a closed-loop system.Taking inspiration from the stacking format of a bento box, Blond designed Dizzie's new packaging to stack together vertically. The three sizes of pots are sized in thirds, so that the height of three small pots equals one large pot, allowing the pots to stack together in many combinations and still reach the same overall height. A groove detail in the lids matches the base profile of the pots, ensuring they can be securely nested together. This helps organize the containers in customers' cupboards as well as allowing secure and efficient transport - a custom transport bag is designed to house a specific number of pots by holding them in place from the top and bottom, and is used for customer delivery and return.In terms of logistics, Blond designed the pots to enable simple and efficient cleaning when returned to the warehouse, while also being cost-effective to manufacture. The pots can efficiently nest together when empty, which saves space in the warehouse and reduces the carbon footprint of transporting them. The efficiencies in the design and choice of material combined with EU production ensure the Dizzie pots have the smallest possible carbon footprint and shift the economies on reusable packaging.Photos: Courtesy of Blond",to create reusable and refillable packaging that is long-lasting and 100% recyclable at the end of its life cycle. reusable and refillable packaging is both long-lasting and 100% recyclable at the end of its life cycle. reusable and refillable packaging is both long-lasting and 100% recyclable at the end of its life cycle.
Vudafieri-Saverino Partners has designed the Chez Pierre restaurant in Monte Carlo for Pierre Baldelli.,https://www.dexigner.com/news/33936,Chez Pierre Restaurant in Monte Carlo by Vudafieri-Saverino Partners,2022-09-25,"Vudafieri-Saverino Partners has designed the Chez Pierre restaurant in Monte Carlo for Pierre Baldelli. Located within the Metropole shopping center, Chez Pierre is an enveloping space with vibrant tones inviting moments of emotion.From concept to realization, Vudafieri-Saverino Partners conceived a project that interprets the history and passion of Pierre Baldelli, taking guests on a journey between Monte Carlo, Paris, and London - the cities where he was trained.Chez Pierre is a secluded and unique venue. The space has 50 seats and 6 bar stools and it is characterized by an atmosphere of retro charm: the black and white marble lozenge floor, a typical stylistic feature of the 1960s, imprints an incisive graphic sign, creating a thread between furnishings, textures and precious combinations.The shade of intense ruby red, also chosen for the Pedrali bar stools with a vintage feel, has a prominent role reflecting the personality of this new gourmet destination that does not want to go unnoticed. The contrast with the neutral tone of Alter Ego Dedar's fabric, textured and iridescent, covering the wall panels, makes the interior style even more sophisticated. Experimentation and innovation, sinuous lines and shapes, bright colors and geometric patterns describe ideas and emotions: the story of a memorable gastronomic experience.The counter is the focus of the restaurant: backlit red striped glass and vertical brass inserts, emphasized on the curves, set the rhythm, while a mirrored wall occupies the back and amplifies the space. Antique mirrors on which follow one another images of the cities of Paris, London and Monte Carlo accompany the overlying fabric that softens the reflection of the mirror. Materials such as wood, brass, glass and soft surfaces such as velvet and leather, lend a sophisticated touch to the room's scenography combining shapes and surfaces with deco details.At lighting level, for a play between reflections and opacity, the white and sculptural pendant lamps Hatton 1 collection by Original BTC have been chosen: made of Bone China ceramic, they feature a facetted rose window and offer a warm and suggestive light.Photography: Santi Caleca",",,,,,, Hatton 1 collection by Original BTC have been chosen: made of Bone China ceramic, they feature a facetted rose window and offer a warm and suggestive light.Photography: the restaurant in Monte Carlo for Pierre Baldelli.

As the development of autonomous vehicles starts to accelerate, interior design will play a much bigger role in the future of cars.Volkswagen Group's GEN.TRAVEL is an innovative design study that will redefine the long-distance mobility of the future. The all-electric Innovation Experience Vehicle (IEV) is a real prototype that drives autonomously (Level 5) and represents a totally new vehicle category in the premium portfolio between limousine and MPV (multi-purpose vehicle). The modular interior concept makes the GEN.TRAVEL a flexible, sustainable Mobility as a Service alternative to short-haul flights.Working, sleeping, entertainment. The GEN.TRAVEL has a unique, modular interior concept that can be customized as required for each journey and booked as a Mobility as a Service offering. Depending on the configuration, up to four people can be transported in the concept vehicle.The interior is bright and naturally designed. Neutral colors reflect the spectrum of the interior lighting concept, ranging from warm to cool tones. The covering of large surfaces with natural elements creates a feeling of luxury. All HMI (Human-Machine Interface) elements are made from sustainable materials such as copper, combined with recycled or natural raw materials such as felt or karuun - a rattan material that can be filled with conductive liquid for functional surfaces of HMI elements. 3D knitting technology is used for the seat covers, and the partition between the comfortable seats is produced using 3D printing.""The GEN.TRAVEL offers us a glimpse of the travel of the future,"" explained Klaus Zyciora, Head of Volkswagen Group Design. ""It shows us what autonomous driving will look like in the future. The GEN.TRAVEL embodies the visionary design of beyond tomorrow for the mobility of tomorrow. Efficient shaping characterizes the extremely distinctive design. Thus, in an age of technical perfection and virtually unlimited possibilities, 'form follows function' becomes 'form follows freedom.' The automobile will not only be better, but also more exciting than ever before.""The interior of the GEN.TRAVEL is free of displays and most normally seen interfaces. Instead, it focuses on voice control and displays information via AR glasses.

Designed by Stark Scott Studio, the collection includes dining, lounge, and rocking chairs and complementary dining and occasional tables.""Our goal was to create a signature collection of outdoor furniture for Pavilion,"" said designer Kevin Stark. ""The unique sense of place created by a hammock-the suspended, kinetic feeling it encourages in its occupant-was our design inspiration,"" added designer Phillip Scott.""We studied the ancient Caribbean craft of making hammocks,"" added designer Lauren Stark. ""The intricate, yet simple construction is akin to how Palmera chairs are made-with 28 contoured rods laid by hand into fixtures, then bonded by 148 resistance welds-marrying handcraft with modern manufacturing processes.""The result is a tranquil escape found in the sculptural, wireframe seat that appears suspended from its continuous-line frame - lending it visual lightness - coupled with a contoured cushion that enhances the leisurely comfort. The seat heights and recline angles ensure an optimal experience for each chair, with the captivating movement of the rocking chair offering particular delight.Gestural lines and tapered legs, reminiscent of palm fronds, are repeated in the complementary tables. The interplay between chairs and tables provides casual comfort and adequate space for each guest. Both seating and tables are scaled to strike a balance between feeling roomy and planning efficiently for contract, hospitality, and residential applications.Designed to perform in demanding environments, including high wind, rooftop, and balcony settings, Palmera brings contract-grade quality with an appealing residential aesthetic to outdoor dining and lounge spaces. Palmera evokes daylight hours spent soaking in the rhythmic nature of the outdoors.Photos: Courtesy of Pavilion","has debuted Palmera, a new collection of outdoor furniture inspired by the contoured embrace of a hammock and the mesmerizing effect of sunlight filtering through palm trees.

The ecosystem has a vast number of applications, infrastructure and support built by an ever-expanding network of developers, entrepreneurs and creatives. It's supported by the NEAR Foundation which fosters innovation through grant funding.The 3.5-day NEARCON event saw 2000+ delegates from the NEAR and Web3 community travel to Lisbon to learn about the NEAR ecosystem, and the latest Web3 developments and technologies. Talks were led by renowned authors, economists, A-list artists, and politicians.NEAR turned to Fold7 for support as it needed a distinct, cut-through identity to mark the occasion - powered by and with a greater focus on, the NEAR brand. Fold7's design solution was inspired by the multiple themes, ideas, discussions, and launches - all coming together in one place, under one brand and one roof.Placing the brand's iconic 'N' infinity symbol at the center and creating a wider visual language from its strong geometry enabled Fold7 to amplify the master brand's signature moves and emphasize its unique identity. The result was a highly modular system that could expand and contract to any given format and play different roles across the scheme - even becoming directional signage at the event space. A crucial element was the motion graphic component which has multiple intensities and modes, responding to the themes or atmospheres throughout the event.""Event identities are always an opportunity to amplify a brand's core communicative elements, to experiment and explore new vantage points,"" commented Tom Munckton, Head of Design at Fold7. ""With the brilliant NEAR team, we carefully unfolded the most potent visual nuances and shone new light on them.

Counterfeit Studio has designed Tessuti's newly acquired unique landmark flagship store in the iconic Liverpool ONE.,https://www.dexigner.com/news/33918,Counterfeit Studio Gives Tessuti A Fresh Elevated Look,2022-09-16,"Counterfeit Studio has designed Tessuti's newly acquired unique landmark flagship store in the iconic Liverpool ONE. Tessuti's 37-year history is built on the same passion for sourcing the latest in premium designer brands as its customers. Born out of a desire for self-expression, escapism and aspiration these values are as relevant today as they've always been and formed a crucial insight for Counterfeit Studio as a base for its creative response.""It was clear from the earliest of briefing stages with the client team that any new direction for Tesutti had to resonate deeply with their customer,"" commented Founder of Counterfeit Studio Murray Aitken. ""To do that, we determined that the solution was to create an adaptive store that could easily showcase launches or activations clearly and authoritatively - a flexible, dynamic and digitally enabled platform to showcase new and established brands.""Given Liverpool's unique sense of identity, for this particular site, Counterfeit Studio drew from the city's rich culture to inform a site-specific tonality. Rather than focusing on obvious references, they delved deep into the city's history, turning to an iconic architectural landmark for inspiration: the Liverpool Overhead Railway (LOR). Known locally as the 'Dockers Umbrella,' the now decommissioned LOR had a host of world firsts, mirroring the inception of Tessuti's flagship.The historic structure's archetypal arch profile became the basis of the architectural language for the store and is replicated around the space as a motif. At the shopfront level, three impressive digital arches are used to link the two-story facade, confidently occupying the generous expanse of glazing.Around the central escalator void, a large stainless steel 'lozenge' is punctuated by arches mimicking the scale of engineering that the LOR represents. The lozenge serves as a striking signature for the store whilst visually drawing consumers' gaze up to the jewel in the store's crown, the XL format digital screen in the soffit above a central atrium. Elsewhere the motif acts as wayfinding, signifying key destinations such as fitting rooms or to highlight brands.The 22,000 square feet store is arranged over three levels, two of which are allocated to trading. The ground floor is dedicated to core brand apparel from the likes of Stone Island, Fiorucci, Billionaire Boys Club, Versace, A.P.C, Norse Projects and C.P. Company. Here, six large digital columns are arranged around the central escalator void. These 'heat zones' fuse product display and content to provide canvases for brand activations, whilst drawing the consumers' eye through the store, punctuating the space.A curved stainless cash desk sits to the rear of the ground floor space highlighted by a crisp line of neon light to clearly demark the service zone. The opposite is a large heat zone, a flexible 'staging' to be used for local pop-ups and activations.Men's and Women's fitting rooms are situated on the rear corners of the floor and continue the feel of a premium space, with dedicated VIP rooms for top-tier customers.The upper floor is accessed via twin escalators leading through the central atrium. Here, clearly defined destinations for Footwear and Accessories divide the space. As with the ground floor, there are several 'heat zones' that allow brands' spaces to tell unique stories.This level is also home to a 3rd party Sneakers ER space, where customers can bring their footwear and luxury bags to be rejuvenated and repaired, adding to the elevated quality of the store experience. A gloss black Piaggio APE van, an Italian Design classic, serves as a mobile apothecary and fragrance station adding a change of pace to the customer journey. A large cash desk, 'Click and collect' station and VIP changing rooms continue the theme of refined service.Materials such as Terrazzo, Brass and Marble are used throughout both levels, these classical Italian materials, signifiers of timeless style, are juxtaposed with contemporary interventions, digital moments, brushed stainless surfaces and neon accents. Texture and pattern come from rough Stucco surfaces to offset the clean lines of fixtures and furniture suggesting a uniquely modern and aspirational space.Photography: French+Tye",", the 'Dockers Umbrella', the Liverpool Overhead Railway (LOR) and the XL format digital screen. the lozenge serves as a striking signature for the store while visually drawing consumers' gaze. the lozenge is punctuated by arches mimicking the scale of engineering that the LOR represents."

Cove establishes a whole new category of products that will take virtual work and screen time to the next level.Experts estimate that by the end of 2022, 25% of all North American professional jobs will be remote-with that number continuing to increase into 2023. Though the work landscape is changing rapidly, current workplace technology desktop design has yet to catch up to many of the new demands associated with remote, hybrid, and even on-site work. Cove, an all-in-one desktop privacy, lighting, sound-damping, and organization product, represents a brand new design-oriented solution to today's increased conferencing and screen time demands.Cove's adjustable diffused lighting, sound-dampening felt interior, and personalizable magnetic surface are meticulously designed to improve focus and privacy while reducing ambient noise and eye strain-all under the ultra-flattering glow of webcam-friendly lighting. It is built to house any tablet, laptop, or monitor up to 27 inches, including the new Apple Studio Display.Natural LED bias backlighting by American Lighting comes with remote-adjustable color brightness, while Cove's antimicrobial recycled TURF felt interior reduces ambient noise and elevates privacy, even in a crowded room. Cove's precision-engineered steel is manufactured in the USA, and its sustainably sourced engineered Baltic Birch shelf is finished in Leon's own workshop.""Blending design with technology is what we do here at Leon,"" commented Leon founder and president Noah Kaplan. ""So when we started seeing post-pandemic work environment changes, we felt like we could use our industry expertise and experiences as creators ourselves to take a new approach to the term 'audiovisual.'

"Morrama recently developed a more sustainable packaging range for restaurant chain wagamama. The new packaging will be implemented across the delivery and takeaway operations, replacing over eight million plastic packaging items.",https://www.dexigner.com/news/33914,Morrama Develops Sustainable Packaging Solution for wagamama,2022-09-15,"Morrama recently developed a more sustainable packaging range for restaurant chain wagamama. The new packaging will be implemented across the delivery and takeaway operations, replacing over eight million plastic packaging items.Approached by wagamama in 2021, the design team was challenged to rethink the restaurant's takeaway packaging to meet the brand's ambitious sustainability goals. Drawing inspiration from the circular economy strategy and with advice from external recycling and packaging experts, the innovation agency first defined the driving principles behind wagamama's packaging redesign: Reduce: wagamama will no longer rely on up to 330 tonnes of virgin plastic every year for its delivery packaging operations; Recycle: wagamama is the first in the industry to use materials made from 70% recycled content; Improve: Morrama worked with both wagamama guests and the design team to improve the overall experience from 'bowl to soul.'Where possible plastic was removed completely. However, despite exploring bio-based and biodegradable materials, plastic remained necessary to preserve the taste and temperature of some dishes and ensure they make it to customers without leakages. To ensure the new packaging range met the sustainability criteria, Morrama spent over a year working alongside a thermoformed food packaging supplier to develop a solution using a new, industry-first recyclable material called cPET.The design of the packaging itself is representative of Morrama's attention to detail. The form is a fresh take on the restaurant's distinctive ramen bowls. Thoughtful considerations extend from how the bowls stack in the bag to how crispy squid is kept crispy, whilst removing excess material at every step. A more natural light sandy tone has replaced the distinctive wagamama grey, reflecting this planet-conscious step forward, and ensuring the materials are more easily picked up by the scanners in recycling plants.""It's been an absolute pleasure to work with the team at wagamama. They are constantly pushing and questioning the sustainable credentials of their packaging, wanting to do the absolute best possible,"" said Jo Barnard, founder of Morrama. ""The goal of this project has been about reduction as well as improving the experience for both their team and guests. We are over the moon with the outcome.""The new packaging began rolling out and will be live across all restaurants and delivery kitchens by October once the old stocks are used up.Photos: Courtesy of Morrama","wagamama has developed a more sustainable packaging range for its restaurant chain wagamama. the new packaging will be implemented across the delivery and takeaway operations, replacing over eight million plastic packaging items."
