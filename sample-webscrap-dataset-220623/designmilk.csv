The Geistmachine ASP series may be the most beautiful – or at least, the most elegant – keyboard line available today, outfitted with maniacally precise fit and finish, a magnetic modular customization system, and even packaging befitting of a luxury good.Geistmachine’s monolithic minimalist slab design centers around a modular ferritic stainless steel band construction that wraps around the entire keyboard. The bands are there to both organize/divide sections of keys and numerical input, while also permitting users to magnetically attach a myriad of accessories.The keyboard’s flat cuboid profile can be lifted with a 6.5-degrees stand to improve ergonomics or it can be removed for typing across a flat configuration. With the stand in place a Flat-Weight can be attached magnetically to the stainless bands and align itself with the U-Stand to improve acoustics and increase the perceived weight/heft with every keystroke.Another detail worth noting – especially for southpaw typists – is the position of the numerical keys. Situated to the left side of the keyboard, this permits more accessible numerical input while also easing access to the right for mouse movements. There’s also the option to add an audio knob, a detail that pairs particularly nicely with the sum of its mechanical-machined aesthetic.Embellished with touches of polished steel, copper, or rose gold Geistmachine positions their pricey peripherals specifically for spaces where an aesthete’s eye for detail requires something special, including design and architecture studios, ateliers, and other hospitality environments.Geistmachine is launching with four different editions, each embellished with distinct choices in materials and surface finishes, with options to further customize.The Engineering Edition leaves materials in their natural color without color-altering surface treatments and often comes with a transparent top housing to reveal the internals underneath and a signature copper bottom case. Starting from $799.The Initial Edition picks unique characteristics of the other editions and recomposes its own edition. The IE often gets introduced first to showcase features of a new project line. Starting from $649.The Graphic Edition resembles contemporary graphic design and timeless elegance of Swiss/German typography. The matte surfaces emphasize the clean lines and monolithic geometries of the design. Starting from $499.The Selected Edition chooses premium materials and surface finishes to create a sophisticated, graceful edition that resembles luxurious jewelry. Starting from $669.All four keyboards are currently on pre-sale at geistmaschine.io through July 6th.Gregory Han is the Managing Editor of Design Milk.

But B&O’s newest offerings representing their ongoing Atelier Editions series takes things to another level. If you’re able to cop one of the 64 Beoplay EX earphones in Forest Green or one of the 15 monolithic cone-shaped Beosound 2 wireless speakers in Gradient Green, consider yourself very fortunate.Inspired by the “abundance of nature in the summer months,” the Gradient Green Atelier Editions version of the 360-degrees sound wireless speaker presents a much more conspicuous presence compared to the normal aluminum, gold tone, or black anthracite options, alongside an even more conspicuous $5,699 price tag. As its name implies, the green sheen of the tinted aluminum speaker deepens across the length, from a lime hued top down to its meadow grass green base.The Forest Green color drop of the Atelier Editions Beoplay EX earphones is a little less striking than its wireless speaker counterpart, but also a tad bit more attainable at just $699. Still, if you’re partial to this hue, note the Danish audio brand is only releasing 64 units.Previous Atelier Editions include Beoplay EX earphones in Peach Pink and Pineapple Yellow colorways.Previous Atelier Editions included a similar Lime Green, Peach Pink, and Pineapple Yellow. These two new green hued editions are available to order till they’re all sold out, surely making those who miss the opportunity green with envy.This post contains affiliate links, so if you make a purchase from an affiliate link, we earn a commission.

Unsurprisingly, electric trucks like the Rivian R1T and Ford Lightning are also doing well, with growing demand for vehicles with load capacity, EV efficiency and performance, technological amenities, and the option to get off the beaten path to seek adventure tempting car buyers into PHEV trucks in droves. But trucks today are increasingly oversized for everyday tasks, especially for those living in urban zip codes where parking a mid or full-size truck can prove challenging. TELO, a new electric truck arrives as the antithesis of the modern pickup, a small but capable EV pickup designed for urbanites who want all of the perks of a truck with a fraction of the parking space footprint.In Japan, small alleyway width Kei trucks are designed to navigate the tightest spaces, aiding city dwellers and farmers alike with a myriad of tasks. But in the United States, even the smallest truck – currently the Hyundai Santa Cruz – still measures close to 200 inches in length and 75 inches in width. Compare those numbers to the 152-inch long TELO, an electric truck comparable in size to a MINI Cooper. Yet this wee work and play vehicle also is outfitted with the same as most Toyota Tacoma trucks (a 5-foot bed; though still smaller than this truck owner’s daily driver, a Tacoma with the 6-foot bed option), and a four-door five-passenger spacious interior.With a pugnacious front somewhat reminiscent of the Canoo pickup truck, but smaller, the TELO’s modest proportions offer something beyond a parking space-friendly demeanor. This little EV can keep on trucking for 350 miles between charges.The TELO’s 106kWh battery pack charges to capacity in just 20-minutes (20-80%), powering a 380 kW dual motor AWD for a total of 500 HP and good for 0-60 in 4 seconds, while delivering 350 miles of range (just enough to get you from Los Angels to San Francisco in one go).The truck’s unique design is the work of fuseproject and Yves Béhar (far right), TELO’s Head of Design and Advisor, here with TELO’s co-founder, CEO Jason Marks and co-founder, CTO Forrest North.“For us, the opportunity to design with the latest EV technology meant that we could create a category defining and environmentally mighty ultra-compact pickup truck,” says TELO’s Head of Design, Yves Béhar. “It is designed for city adventurers who want a vehicle nimble enough for city streets and robust enough for outdoor exploring, with plenty of space for their people and gear. It has been an honor to bring to life an unparalleled EV truck which offers best-in-class utility, safety and all around drivability.”The TELO’s bed capacity is expandable thanks to a specially designed mid-partition between the back-seat and the truck bed. Folded down, longer items can intrude from the truck bed into the interior of the truck, enabling transport of items as large as 4-feet by 8-feet sheets of plywood, long ladders, or as shown here, an armada of 9-foot surfboards.TELO is being aimed at “urban adventurers” seeking the practicality of a small footprint vehicle for the daily tasks with the load capacity and power of a traditional truck, and noting our own positive response to this design, TELO has a good possibility of establishing an entirely new segment sorely lacking in the United States market: the mini electric truck.TELO will retail for $49,999 (not including State and Federal Electric Vehicle Tax Credits) and is currently available for pre-order with a deposit of $152 at www.telotrucks.com.Gregory Han is the Managing Editor of Design Milk.

technology,2023-06-16,Gregory Han,Rivian Wants to Redesign EV Shopping Into an Inviting Space,https://design-milk.com/rivian-wants-to-redesign-ev-shopping-into-an-inviting-space/,Rivian wants to make buying one of their EV trucks or SUVs a casual and pressure-free experience with the launch of Rivian Spaces.,"“Disruptive” is thrown reflexively and regularly when discussing electric vehicles’ impact upon automotive manufacturing, fuel efficiency, mobility technologies, and ultimately how we drive. But alongside these developing changes, the public’s expectations related to the car shopping experience is also evolving, one veering away from the haggle and hassle of dealership-oriented car buying of yesteryear. The introduction of EV truck and SUV maker Rivian’s Spaces in New York City’s Meatpacking District is the first of several brick-and-mortar retail showrooms meant to connect with new EV buyers who want to casually get to know the brand, vehicles, and electric vehicle technologies all without the dreaded hard sell.“Rivian Spaces are purposefully designed to be casual and inviting, where anyone who is curious is welcome to come in to learn more about us and our products,” said Denise Cherry, Senior Director of Facilities Design and Retail Development at Rivian. “We’ve peeled away the formality that can be associated with automotive retail and focused on creating a relaxed, family-friendly environment that invites guests to stay awhile and discover at their own pace.” That’s all a nice way of saying Rivian’s Spaces are imagined to be more like other retail experiences and less of the unwelcome persuasive spiel attached to today’s auto dealerships.A render for comparison. Located under the High Line in New York City, the product displays inside the New York City Spaces are made from diverted ocean-bound plastics from Rivian’s factory in Normal, Illinois while greenery throughout takes cues from the High Line which is just above the retail space.Cherry emphasizes the difference between these Spaces and a traditional dealership is their “casual, warm atmosphere”, an environment expressed through their choices in materials, eclectic furnishings and interactive educational displays. “Through Spaces, we want to inspire people to imagine where they can go and what they can do in a Rivian.”Additionally, reflective of Rivian’s environmental efforts in manufacturing their vehicles, so too will Spaces be designed with consideration of their footprint and impact. “For example, for our 10th Avenue Space in New York City, we intentionally minimized the structural buildout in favor of modular components that can be moved from site to site,” explains Cherry, “Future Spaces locations like Laguna Beach, CA and Groveland, CA, showcase adaptive reuse, breathing new life and purpose into existing structures.”Rivian is bringing in architectural experts to ensure historically-significant features of the historic South Coast theater were retained while updating the interior to contemporary energy, code, and accessibility standards.Rivian Spaces will eventually roll out across the country in other markets, joining the company’s existing network of over two dozen service centers across the U.S. and Canada. These other new Spaces include a showroom housed within a converted movie theater in downtown Laguna Beach, California (above), and also an indoor-outdoor 10,000-square-foot site in Austin, Texas complete with a green space, rooftop patio with panoramic views of the city. Rivian emphasizes the architecture and interior design of each location will reflect their locale, including distinct furnishings within.Rivian’s 10,000 sq. ft. Austin Space will offer direct access to the Ladybird Lake biking and running trail in the city’s South Congress district and a rooftop patio.Space in Williamsburg, BrooklynRivian Space in Groveland, California – a gateway town to Yosemite National Park – is housed within a former historic gas station converted into a modern cabin design aligned with the brand’s modernist adventure lifestyle.In numerous ways Rivian is steering the EV buyer closer to something akin to customers and the Apple Store, wooing potential customers into uniquely designed retail destinations showcasing product to try without the hovering pressure to buy, emphasizing product-focused experiences and education rather than immediate sales. While nothing is guaranteed, we’re apt to predict the future of buying your next car will become nearly as easy as buying an iPhone one day – albeit a bit more expensive.The first Rivian Space opens today, June 16th, at 60 10th Avenue in New York City’s Meatpacking District, with additional locations TBD.

technology,2023-06-15,Gregory Han,Samsung New Bespoke Family Hub Refrigerator Doubles Down on Screen Size,https://design-milk.com/samsung-new-bespoke-family-hub-refrigerator/,"Have you ever considered adding a large screen appliance within the context of the social hub of the home, the kitchen?","The earliest versions of Samsung’s Family Hub refrigerators offered what many considered little more than a tablet inset into a refrigerator door experience. But remember, Samsung is the same company that lead the charge with super-sizing phones, nearly single-handedly creating the market for large screen mobile devices known then as “phablets.” No surprise Samsung is taking a similar committed route within the kitchen, maximizing their smart home dashboard and SmartThings ecosystem to an impressive extreme.The new Samsung Bespoke 4-Door Flex Refrigerator with Family Hub+ is a smart home enabled appliance outfitted with an enormous 32-inch, bezel-less, full-HD screen designed to assist in everyday tasks: following recipes, scheduling/planning, monitoring myriad of smart home controls, or even just catching up on some streaming programming.Samsung’s newest Family Hub+ powered fridge doubles the screen size of their previous model; it’s now nearly as large as one of the refrigerator doors. With support for Google Photos, users won’t have to clutter their fridge with paper and magnets.Like other Samsung Bespoke refrigerators, this new Family Hub+ model will eventually allow customization of color and finishes to match the rest of your kitchen. Bespoke Family Hub+ is available in full depth ($4,999) and counter depth ($5,099) models.Over the span of eight iterations Samsung has committed to making their line of Family Hub technology enhanced smart refrigerators a standard in the evolution of kitchen appliances, integrating ever larger and more capable app-powered displays right into the refrigerator doors.One benefit of this much larger fridge screen is the option to check the contents within without even opening the door. Built-in AI cameras inside allow a peek inside to determine if you should even bother opening the fridge or get working on a new grocery list.If you already bring a tablet or phone into the kitchen to view recipes, text friends/family, or stream content while cooking or eating, the utility of a 32-inch screen is going to be obvious. Daily tasks like meal planning, creating shopping lists, viewing family calendars, and monitoring connected smart home devices are made more easily accessible and legible. Samsung has integrated 190 Samsung TV Plus free channels to watch from the refrigerator screen (albeit with a vertical aspect ratio), with picture-in-picture (PIP) viewing as an option – such is the benefit of a screen nearly as large as a small 4K television nearly stretching the entire expanse of one of the fridge doors.The sleek front of the fridge hides behind one of its doors a hidden interior water dispenser and AutoFill Water Pitcher, complemented by a Dual Auto Ice Maker offering both cubed ice or smaller bite-sized cubes.Of course the benefits of this latest, or any of the Bespoke Family Hub+ powered refrigerators, is magnified if you’re already invested in Samsung’s own SmartThings ecosystem. Samsung hopes to entice users to buy into their whole range of connected devices – from Galaxy phones, to washers and dryers, smart watches, and this fridge. But even sans that degree of brand/app loyalty, the convenience and options proposed by a built-in 32-inch display is undeniably a unique proposition, one that may warrant reconsideration of what a fridge is capable of offering beyond what the appliances have always done.The new Samsung Bespoke 4-Door Flex Refrigerator with Family Hub+ is available now for $4999 for Full Depth and $5099 for Counter Depth.This post contains affiliate links, so if you make a purchase from an affiliate link, we earn a commission.

technology,2023-06-15,Gregory Han,Google's Holographic Project Starline Adds a New Dimension to Working From Home,https://design-milk.com/googles-holographic-project-starline-adds-a-new-dimension-to-working-from-home/,Google's desk-sized video chat technology adds a sense of physical dimension and eye contact in nearly life-sized scale.,"Google recognizes many of us are still working remotely and suffering from the same longstanding issues related to working together while not being physically within the same space. In 2021 the company revealed Project Starline as a possible answer to this dilemma, a concept merging hardware and AI-enhanced software to create a “magic window” where users could “talk, gesture and make eye contact naturally with other people in life-size and in three dimensions.” The premise is sort of like a futuristic phone booth and photo booth, with some shades of the holographic communication technology from the Star Wars universe.But that first 3D teleconferencing video booth required a room-sized setup. At this year’s Google’s I/O developer conference Google revealed they’ve been able to shrink Project Starline down to a much more manageable size, one comparable to a large computer display or flat screen television.Like the first iteration, the system uses advanced AI to conjure what is perceived as a photorealistic recreation of the person chatting with you. It does this using a light field display capable of producing perceptible elements of volume and depth that make the person seem “right there.” Instead of looking at a flattened image of a colleague, Project Starline produces a more convincing in-person view retaining the all-important element of eye contact sorely lacking during Zoom, Meet, and other video chat solutions currently available.Google isn’t the only company making efforts to improve video chats; Logitech’s lounge-like Project Ghost video conferencing booth alsom invites a dimensional window-like gaze with other speakers.Google says they’ve already gotten these prototypes into the corporate settings within Salesforce, T-Mobile, and WeWork, but the real test will be when they’re able to further simplify this multi-camera setup for home offices for remote workers, sans the necessity for IT expertise, a future that may supplement or supplant AR/VR glasses.Read all about Project Starline at the Google Blog.Gregory Han is the Managing Editor of Design Milk.

art,2023-06-12,Kelly Beall,Code/Craft/Chaos: The Space Between Man + Machine in Art,https://design-milk.com/code-craft-chaos-the-space-between-man-machine-in-art/,Here design studio posed a big question at London Craft Week 2023: Can technology help us make beautiful art?,"As the space between man and machine continues to grow smaller, design agency Here went to work exploring the rapidly evolving gap between craft and technology. The big question: Can technology help us make beautiful art? The fear is of course that it will lead to lifeless work that lacks both depth and meaning. During London Craft Week, Here shared Code/Craft/Chaos to challenge this viewpoint while transforming digitally generated patterns into crafted pieces of art. In doing so, Here paid homage to Vera Molnar, known as the pioneer of Generative Art. She once famously said, “The machine, thought to be cold and inhuman, can help to realize what is most subjective, unattainable, and profound in a human being.”Here is a B-corp certified company of thinkers, writers, designers, and makers committed to Beautility: making good choices desirable. In Code/Craft/Chaos, digitally generated patterns are turned into crafted artworks using algorithms, making the evolution from pixels to physical, sustainable objects. Handcrafted tapestries, ceramics, screen prints, music, and poetry all received a go at the treatment. Here teamed up with like-minded, environmentally conscious makers and suppliers to turn these experiments into art with their end-of-life in mind. All materials were chosen with care to create the smallest footprint on the planet – from locally printed screen prints to tapestries woven from fashion offcuts.Even working with something as intangible as an algorithm, all artwork materials have been chosen with care to create the smallest impact possible on the planet. “We believe that the advancements within tech are a wonder, an asset, and one of humanity’s finest achievements,” said Connor Davey, Design Lead at Here. “Our latest Craft Week exhibition explores working generatively in this rapidly evolving place where man and machine meet. We’ve embraced the ways in which human subjectivity and soul can transform code-generated art to create pieces that embody our own company’s ‘code’ of value: making things that are both beautiful and useful.”The humble pixel led the way as pattern making was explored with generative techniques. Ben Elwyn, Creative Technologist at Here, shared that “GLSL shaders were coded to traverse and harness the controlled chaos of simplex noise to create a variety of patterns that evolved over time. By taking snapshots of these morphing designs, we created an abundance of imagery to be interpreted, curated, and crafted into other 2D and 3D forms in a diverse range of new and traditional materials.” Six works were included in Code/Craft/Chaos: Carbon Clever Screen Prints, a Code-Woven Quilt, Cyber Ceramics, a Digi Throw, Pixel Poetry, and Codes of Notes.Hand-printed collages born from code, Carbon Clever Screen Prints began with an endless selection of computer-generated patterns. Here turned the random chaos into something more by digitally collaging patterns that were then locally screen-printed onto eco-conscious paper from GF Smith using Living Ink’s Algae Black™ – a carbon negative ink made from algae, not petroleum.Here’s Code-Woven Quilt brings together digitally generated art and the craft of hand-weaving a tapestry. After being turned into a one-of-a-kind tapestry, the quilt was made from waste fabrics donated by responsible cashmere manufacturer Alex Begg. The project also required assistance from UK-based studio, ReWeave, who specialize in woven textile products and explore the possibility of circular fashion on an industrial scale. Yarn was created from the cashmere waste, giving shape to the quilt as code and craft were combined.Digitally generated 3D-printed ceramics have received their fair share of coverage, but the approach to Cyber Ceramics is more nuanced. Beginning with 2D shapes generated by code, Here turned their favorites into 3D bowls and had them printed within a mile of their studio. Because color was introduced to the clay in lumps, each appears at random, making every bowl unique. During the exhibition, the bowls were combined to form totem-like structures – afterward they could be disassembled and go back to their utilitarian purpose. Designed to last, these pieces explore the infinite forms that can be created using a combination of code and craft.To create the Digi Throw, Here worked with Netherlands-based creative textiles platform Byborre to responsibly source sustainable thread. The digitally made blankets layer machine-made patterns into a design of vibrant neon colors that complement the other artworks on display. Digi Throw is made from Byborre’s most sustainable material, a recycled polyester that’s made from post-consumption plastic bottles in Italy before being transformed into fabric without the use of chemicals. The process emitted 29.10% less carbon and saved 31.11 liters of water in making the throws when compared to the creation of traditional fashion textiles. From start to finish nothing goes to waste, because the blankets will only be made once they reach a minimum order quantity.Perhaps a bit more unexpected, poetry can be created in collaboration with a machine – check out Pixel Poetry. Words are their own type of material and can be recycled all the same. In this case, short stories were written by hand for the exhibit before becoming redacted at random by machine. The result is complete chaos, but it’s entirely your own.From words it’s only a natural progression to music. Codes of Notes is an animated triptych that moves in response to melodies generated using machines, but composed and arranged by a human. Collaged computer-generated soundbites created a new composition, while Here curated and arranged them into a harmony. In the end, human musicians played the music on their instruments, adding the elements of heart and soul to the digital masterpiece. Alongside, three generative animations respond to the music as it heightens, bringing with them even more unpredictable, chaotic algorithms.To learn more about Here and the rest of their portfolio, visit heredesign.com.Kelly Beall is senior editor at Design Milk.

Our partners are hand-picked by the Design Milk team because they represent the best in design.Can we ask you something personal? How often do you clean your floors? If you’re like us, busy and stretched thin, probably not as often as you’d like. Wayward pieces of popcorn, strands of hair, stains from spills past and forgotten, with a community of dust bunnies peeking out from underneath the sofa – they are all remnants and reminders of responsibilities deferred till “tomorrow.” But we understand – cleaning can be a tedious task, especially within homes with a mix of floor surfaces, requiring switching between vacuuming and mopping. Thankfully, autonomous cleaning technologies designed to relieve the burden of everyday chores have continued to improve to the point where there is a strong argument that every home should have a bit of robotic help around the house.This is where the state-of-the-art ECOVACS DEEBOT T20 OMNI presents a very compelling solution: a 4-stage autonomous cleaning system equipped to solve the either/or dilemma of cleaning both hard and soft surfaces. Equipped with a flexible vacuum and mop hybrid system, complete with integrated hot water mop and drying, the DEEBOT T20 OMNI distinguishes itself from other robot vacuum cleaners by offering an unmatched degree of cleaning capabilities without compromise, cleaning and emptying dry or wet debris automatically.The fully sealed style OMNI base station is where dust and allergens are automatically emptied into and also where the unit self-washes with hot water for maintenance-free cleaning for more than 60 days at a time.The promise of a cleaner home done faster – and better – than other robot vacuums is made possible by ECOVACS’s OZMO Turbo 2.0 mopping system, a hot water mop washing technology engineered to automatically detect grime while gliding across hard surfaces, applying a water heated pressure wash at 131°F to easily remove stains and loosen debris. A pair of spinning mop heads rotate 180 times per minute to make floors sparkle before concluding with a blow of hot air, speeding up drying for near instantaneous results.Regardless of your home’s decor and furnishing, the T20 OMNI is ready to confidently negotiate any floor plan using the same LiDAR-based technology that helps self-driving cars navigate city streets.Imagine sending out the DEEBOT T20 OMNI for one last clean sweep on days when you have guests coming over. Or scheduling the vac every morning after you leave for work, ensuring you return to a home that is cleaner than when you left. Instead of worrying about wet footprints or slips and slides, you can trust that your floors will be dry and safe for kids, pets, and everyone else at home.In addition to these standout features, the DEEBOT T20 Omni robotic vacuum excels in everyday vacuuming duties with its intelligent mapping system. An array of sensors allows for efficient and thorough cleaning, effortlessly navigating through normal furnishings and everyday objects within the home, and capable of getting to those hard-to-reach nooks and crannies most robot vacuums skip over.The vacuum’s powerful category-leading 6000Pa suction power suction, aided by a new rubber brush with spiraling blades, ensures that every speck of dirt is grabbed, leaving no trace behind. Most importantly, the DEEBOT T20 Omni’s strength is its adaptability and versatility, equipped with sensors that can automatically detect whether your floors require vacuum-only cleaning, mop-only cleaning, vacuuming while mopping, or vacuuming first before mopping.ECOVACS designed the DEEBOT T20 Omni to be fully compatible with smart home systems, allowing you to control and schedule cleaning sessions with ease using Alexa, Google Assistant, Siri Shortcuts or by calling out, “OK YIKO” with the ECOVACS app.The DEEBOT T20 Omni is a shining example of how the smart home has advanced to a degree where robotic technologies no longer exist as speculative “in the future” promises, but are now genuinely making the most mundane of everyday duties less burdensome, and adapting to how you live instead of requiring you to adapt to the technology you’ve invited into your home.

Those are just a few of the evocations of tinted memories that inspired luxury Italian appliance brand Smeg to release a new series of colors, enhancing their already iconic FAB28 refrigerator silhouette with a bold refresh that aligns with the growing trend of inviting colors into the kitchen.Eight colors were initially previewed in Milan in 2022 as candidates to be voted upon before choosing the final “colors of Smeg’s summer 2023.” Voters deemed Azzurro Blue, Perfectly Pale, and Rust as favorites; a Matte Black option was added to round off this quartet of soft touch matte surface refrigerators.As someone who has been mulling over a new refrigerator for our mother-in-law’s kitchenette, the FAB28 proposes a more enriching element to the kitchen than the austere and cold options typical of appliances.Inside, the FAB28 Refrigerator remains the same, housing three adjustable glass shelves, one fixed glass shelf, a bottle rack, fruit and vegetable container, and dairy box. Despite its slim size, there are also two adjustable covered bins, two bottle storage bins, four adjustable bins, and two egg bins across the door, with LED lights illuminating the interior, an adjustable thermostat, and MultiFlow air distribution to keep produce fresh as long as possible.Except for the blue option, the earthen collection presents a more contemporary, rather than retro, feel.While three of these new colors are inspired by hues of the Italian landscape in summer, the matte black addition is marked as the final component of Smeg’s modern matte black range of kitchen appliances and accessories, which includes a kettle, toaster, and new Classic oven finish for an entirely modernist noir aesthetic.The entire range of new colors for the FAB28 are available for £1,899 via shop.smeguk.com and Smeg’s Regent Street flagship store. No word on if these new colors will make it to the US or not.Gregory Han is the Managing Editor of Design Milk.

technology,2023-06-05,Gregory Han,Teenage Engineering TP–7 Offers the Reel Sensation of Tactile Controls,https://design-milk.com/teenage-engineering-tp-7-offers-the-reel-sensation-of-tactile-controls/,"Teenage Engineering's master class audio device TP-7 is designed for true, one-hand operation, emphasizing the senses of touch, sound, and sight.","The touchscreen display is one of the greatest – and polarizing – inventions in modern times. While a display interface on a mobile device can transform into an endless array of configurations and purposes, that adaptability in utility comes at a price: losing the sheer simplicity of operating by tactile feedback. It is almost always easier to press a button or turn a dial than navigating a graphical interface – “tap to open, scroll, and press.”This is particularly true when capturing audio, a task I often rely upon while interviewing subjects using my iPhone. I make it a habit to have the app ready ahead of recording to prevent the dreaded instance of “GAH! I wasn’t recording” every journalist runs into at one time or another. Even when operating correctly I’m perpetually checking to make sure it’s recording because of the lack of physical (and aural) indications my device is correctly recording.The Teenage Engineering TP–7 field recorder is an interesting proposition, not so much a compromise, but a digital recording device designed to invite the fingers to intuitively utilize physical controls just like an analog tape recorder of yore: the index finger triggers fast forward, the middle finger rewinds, the thumb records a memo, and the pinky selects the mode.Just as early computing and mobile device design veered toward skeuomorphism – the approach in making digital tools resemble their real-world counterparts – so can be said of the TP–7’s form, one mimicking the appearance and movement of a motorized tape reel to clearly communicate the device is in fact recording.Inside the TP-7 is a brushed motor with ball bearings, and a highly sensitive hall sensor that lets you virtually grab your recording. The reel is a cool gimmick, but one that is engineered to be used in conjunction with a novel side-mounted rocker that gives the user the option to scrub, fast forward, and rewind by touch. The entire physical interface would take mere minutes, perhaps seconds, for a new user to figure out. It also comes with the perk of a scrubbing action propelling the wheel accompanied with a ’hyperspeed’ sound for amusing effect.Kudos to Teenage Engineering for also launching the TP–7 with an accompanying app to automatically transcribe any audio interviews to text.TP–7 features three stereo two-way jacks to be used as either inputs or outputs, for connecting external mics, headphones, studio monitors, or any other audio equipment like OP–1 field or TX–6, recording with all 6 stereo channels. The recorder is compatible with USB-C for multi-channel audio interface, MIDI, data transfer, and charging, with Bluetooth Low Energy and MFi capability for wireless connectivity. TP–7 also includes our 6.35 mm to 3.5 mm jack adapter, and up to 128 GB of internal storage (which equates to 5 minutes of ideas a day for 20 years).The Teenage Engineering TP–7 field recorder is not designed for everyone, especially at its eye-bulging price (the very reason I haven’t rushed out to buy one myself). It is by design a purposely particular device for particular people. But for anyone who regularly relies upon recording audio for professional purposes, we wouldn’t blame you for caving into the temptation to splurge hard upon a device engineered to record interviews, capture sound or music, or to use in similar fashion as Twin Peak’s Agent Cooper in such stylish and touching fashion.Gregory Han is the Managing Editor of Design Milk.

technology,2023-06-02,Gregory Han,The Hervet Manufacturier Bellame Speaker Captures a Daft 70s Vibe,https://design-milk.com/the-hervet-manufacturier-bellame-speaker-captures-a-daft-70s-vibe/,"Just 100 of these retro-futuristic audio systems are being handmade to bridge ""the gap between fine woodworking and high-fidelity sound.""","There was a time when you couldn’t walk into any space – club, restaurant, bar, shop, party – without the ubiquity of the Daft Punk musical catalog ever present. The musical duo’s imprint wasn’t just melodic, but an entire retro-futuristic aesthetic… a whole damn vibe, if you may. Cousins Cédric and Nicolas Hervet have continued to build upon that vibe, founding spatio-temporal hi-fi boutique brand Hervet Manufacturier with the elder of the two, Cedric, helping keep the Daft Punk party going as the duo’s Artistic Director.Hervet Manufacturier’s latest Bellame Speaker system plays tribute to that musical duo and the vintage recording studios from the 70s and 80s they inhabit in the form of a handcrafted, limited edition audio system bridging “the gap between fine woodworking and high-fidelity sound.”The Bellame speakers shares the design DNA of pedestal floor speaker designs that once proliferated home and studios throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, most notably the Eero Saarinen designed Bose 901s. These current day speakers are built around a sizable enclosure with left/right satellites tasked for mid-high frequencies and a dual bass all enclosed within a solid Santos rosewood cabinetry, each stationed upon brushed stainless steel stands and reinforcement parts with full-grain leather-covered baffles.The dual bass enclosure features 10-inch paper cone drivers mounted on the front to really bring forth the oomph of bass.Within this enclosure, all the necessary electronics are integrated to power the dual bass enclosure and the left/right satellites responsible for mid-high frequencies, featuring 8 line inputs and an MM phono input for turntable integration. There’s also a 24-bit/192 kHz DAC with 5 inputs, including USB-A and USB-B. Note, you will need to invest in an optional dongle for Bluetooth connectivity, which seems one glaring omission from an otherwise comprehensive system for plug and play use (but perhaps wholly in spirit with the 70s-80s reference).A simplified control panel includes a volume adjustment and a remote control receiver for easy control from the listening area.The sum of components within the Bellame delivers a power output rated for 2×75 W (satellites) and 220 W for the bass emanating center receiver console unit, plenty to fill a large living room, and then some.If you ever see one of these Bellame Speakers in the wild around the world, consider yourself fortunate. There will only be 100 of these made by Hervet Manufacturier for a princely sum of $20,990, a handcrafted audio experience warranting the request, “one more time.”Gregory Han is the Managing Editor of Design Milk.

technology,2023-06-01,Gregory Han,Leica Q3: The Travel and Street Photography Camera Perfected?,https://design-milk.com/leica-q3-the-travel-and-street-photography-camera-perfected/,Leica's third in the Q series keeps all the great design cues of the Q2 with the addition of a 3-inch high resolution touchscreen.,"Money cannot buy happiness… but it can help you buy a Leica. The German camera manufacturer’s legions of devotees have long elevated the red circle badged cameras from mere imaging tools into aspirational photographic heirlooms. Credit the brand’s timeless appeal to a reputation built upon carefully machined minimalist bodies, distinct optics, veneration associated with some of the most famous photos and photographers, and no doubt the exclusivity of owning a standout design that evokes envy. The newest full frame Leica Q3 camera will likely further burnish this storied rep, adding upon its 2019 predecessor with both subtle and major upgrades, in sum offering what may be considered the ultimate street photography camera.Taking a similar approach to Apple’s incremental improvements with the iPhone, Leica has retained many of the best attributes of the 2019 Q2, an approach that seems to make sense considering the Q2 has remained extremely popular to this day. This third iteration shares the same 28mm f/1.7 Summilux ASPH lens, a fantastic walk-around optics now further enhanced by the newly upgraded 60 mega-pixel BSI CMOS sensor with Triple Resolution Technology, allowing for 60, 36, or 18 MP resolution. As an amateur nature photographer, I’m thrilled to see the Q3 equipped with an integrated macro mode, allowing the ability to get as close as 17 cm to subjects.There’s also the inclusion of the same digital zoom of previous Q models, offering cropping to focal lengths of 28, 35, 50, 75, and 90 mm; those who like to shoot specifically for online content will also benefit from two new and practical assistants: Leica Perspective Control and Leica Dynamic Range (designed to ensure perfect JPEG images without any post processing).Content creators take note: the new Q3 can record video at 8k resolution and in H.265 and Apple’s ProRes codecs; USB-C and HDMI accessories are also supported.Though we’ve yet to get our own hands on a production model, the 3rd in the Q series seems to share all of the same desirable design cues that have made the Q2 an influencer darling. It looks as beautifully crafted, retaining the handsome contrast between cross-hatched front to machined metal body. What has changed is the addition of new tiltable, water- and dust-resistant IP52 certified 3-inch high resolution touchscreen with 5.76 million resolution, addressing a glaring omission from its predecessor.And as another sign of the continuing convergence between digital photography and mobile photography, the Leica Q3 now supports wireless charging via an optional Leica Drop XL Wireless Charger and separate camera handgrip. Designed by Native Union, the combo makes the case the digital camera category still has a few more features (beyond vastly superior optics and usable resolution) to keep cameras relevant amongst photographers beyond devotees of pricey German industrial design.This post contains affiliate links, so if you make a purchase from an affiliate link, we earn a commission.
