Using interfering screens in an object reminiscent of a puppet theatre, this stop-motion installation unearths Nokomis, the Wise Grandmother whispering the Sacred Teachings to Baby Girl, in parallel to Jesus shepherding her through seven Deadly Sins.The installation is based on Calder’s 2021 NFB stop-motion animated short Meneath: The Hidden Island of Ethics, winner of nine awards and named one of the top 10 short films of the year by the Toronto International Film Festival.About the experience:In the middle of Turtle Island, a Métis Baby Girl is born. Her childhood wonder is disrupted when Jesus appears and tells her about the so-called sins of humanity. Convinced she is soiled and destined for Hell, the abuse and racism she endures leave her riddled with self-loathing and fear. To quell her trauma, Nokomis brings light to the Anishinaabe Teachings buried deep within Baby Girl. For every alleged Sin Baby Girl receives, she also gets a Teaching that fills her with strength and pride and affirms a path toward healing.Through a system of interfering screens, Calder directs the viewer’s gaze below the surface to witness a “dissection of the colonial narrative, physically shifting the dominant Christian perspective.” The installation offers an augmented reality-type “looking glass into the Indigenous ethical voice that often remains hidden.” Indigenous Teachings are reflected from the earth and fused into the story to create a unique viewing experience that varies based on the viewer’s position in proximity to the interfering screens.Meneath: The Mirrors of Ethics” features the voice of Gail Maurice (Cardinal, Tricksters) and was edited by the late Indigenous filmmaker Jeff Barnaby (Rhymes for Young Ghouls, Blood Quantum). Jelena Popović produces with Eloi Champagne as technical director and Jason Ryle as consulting producer. The executive producers are Robert McLaughlin and Michael Fukushima for the NFB English Program Animation & Interactive Studio.Calder is a Canadian Métis artist and multidisciplinary creator.

NYSE is home to major multimedia powerhouses like Disney, SONY, Roblox, AMC, and others. We are heading into our next phase of growth, so the timing is ideal for us as a company and our shareholders to make the move. I encourage investors to join ‘Stan Lee,’ along with management and the board, as he rings the NYSE opening bell on June 26, 2023, to celebrate this momentous occasion.”Heyward explained that the “defining focus of our new ‘Kartoon’ and animation rebranding reflects the recent vertical integration of the business following several acquisitions over the past year, including WOW! Unlimited Media in Canada and its subsidiaries Frederator Studios, Frederator Network and Mainframe Entertainment; Ameba TV; Beacon Media; as well as taking a major stake in Germany’s Your Family Entertainment, the largest children’s animation catalog in Europe.”“We now have capabilities to do everything in-house, from content creation to production, distribution, and global merchandising,” he added. “Along with its name changes, the company is also expanding its content across wider demographics, ranging from toddlers to young adults, including its recently launched series, Shaq’s Garage, which premiered on Pluto TV. It stars and is co-produced by NBA legend Shaquille O’Neal.”Through the company’s Frederator Studios subsidiary, it aims to develop content for a broader audience. Heyward noted, “We have an exclusive deal with BuzzFeed Animation Lab to develop select properties into full series based on hit YouTube shorts, including Chikn’ Nuggit. Frederator also signed a deal with Jimmy Kimmel’s Wheelhouse DNA and YouTuber Adam Waheed ‘Adam W’ for an animated series. Concurrently, the company’s series, Bee and PuppyCat, co-produced with TOHO of Japan, has been a breakout hit that led to a Netflix series and merchandise program with Hot Topic.”“While other companies in the entertainment industry are struggling and declining in the current economic market and industry challenges, Kartoon Studios continues to rapidly grow, best illustrated by a nearly eight-fold increase in revenue for 2022,” noted Heyward. “Multiple new productions are in various stages of development,” said Heyward. “The company is in development on Blue Origin Space Rangers, in partnership with Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin and Michael Strahan’s SMAC productions. And finally, we are in development on Wolfgang Puck’s Chef Academy, in collaboration with the world’s pioneering celebrity chef, Wolfgang Puck.”“The Kartoon Channel! distribution platform, under the leadership of Walt Disney veterans Todd Steinman domestically and Paul Robinson internationally, continues to grow worldwide,” he continued. “In the U.S., the platform has 100% television household market penetration across a broad range of distribution platforms, including Comcast, Cox, DISH, Sling TV, Amazon Prime, Amazon Fire, Apple TV, Apple iOS, Android TV, Android Mobil, Google Play, Xumo, Roku, Tubi, YouTube, KartoonChannel.com, Samsung Smart TVs and LG TVs, as well as on multiple airline entertainment systems.”Heyward concluded, “Internationally, Kartoon Channel! is currently available in key territories around the world, including the recently announced Africa and Sub-Sahara Africa (StarTimes), Australia and New Zealand (Samsung TV Plus), Germany (Waipu), Philippines (Tapp Digital).

When Fanny’s pretend distress turns into real trouble, Oswald rows to the rescue, and the pair make waves as they battle their way back to shore. Trolley Troubles (1927)Trolley Troubles launched Walt Disney’s Oswald the Lucky Rabbit cartoon series (although it was the second short to go into production) featuring Oswald as a trolley conductor trying to keep things on track.

Bone Trouble (1940)This first official entry in the Pluto cartoon series finds our intrepid pup on the run after stealing a bone from Butch, the bulldog, and finding refuge in a carnival, “Hall of Mirrors.”  His initial fear of the distortions leads to a fun-filled adventure where he takes advantage of the mirrors to fend off Butch.Merbabies (1938)Walt Disney enlisted former colleagues Hugh Harman and Rudy Ising to help create this underwater Silly Symphony.

Pluto is hopping mad at first when the visitors wreck his new doghouse and eat his food, but Mickey welcomes the opportunity to have a boxing partner. All’s well that ends well as they come together as a most unusual extended family.Playful Pluto (1934)Pluto tries to help Mickey with some spring cleaning and leaf gathering, but the day descends into chaos with the arrival of a whirlwind, a leaky hose with a mind all its own, and a fly invasion. Pluto gets into a sticky situation with a roll of flypaper, which leads to some of his most memorable scenes.Pluto, Junior (1942)Pluto and Pluto Junior are enjoying a lazy afternoon snooze when the playful pup tangles with a ball, a balloon, a worm, a bird, and a clothesline.

The campers counterattack with some resourceful countermoves.Chips Ahoy (1956)Hungry chipmunks Chip and Dale are down to their last acorn when they spot an acorn-laden tree belonging to Donald Duck across the lake. Pirating Donald’s ship from inside a bottle, the resourceful duo makes their way to the tree, but not without interference from Donald. They take the wind out of Donald’s sail and end up having the last laugh.Fiddling Around (1930)Mickey Mouse shows a wide range of expressions and emotions (and even sports long hair) in this one-mouse virtuoso violin performance. He faces an unseen audience and a heckler as he earnestly plays several pieces, including the Hungarian Dance and the William Tell Overture. Walt Disney directed this film, which is also known as Just Mickey.Inferior Decorator (1948)Donald Duck stirs up a hornet’s nest of trouble when he tangles with a bee named Spike, who is trying to pollinate Donald’s floral wallpaper.
