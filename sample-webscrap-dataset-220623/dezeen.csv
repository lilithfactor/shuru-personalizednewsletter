""We worked together and shared a life with a beautiful family for 61 years. Michael was obsessive about architecture and tenacious in refining a design until he was absolutely satisfied with it.""""He was usually (and annoyingly) right,"" she continued. ""He made the world – and the buildings so many people live work, and learn in – more beautiful. We will miss him more than we can imagine”.He was awarded the RIBA Royal Gold Medal, jointly with Patty Hopkins, in 1994. Projects designed by his studio have been shortlisted for the UK's top architecturee award – the Stirling Prize – four times.Influential buildings designed by Hopkins Architects include the industrial-looking Hopkins House, the Schlumberger Research Centre, Westminster Underground Station, Portcullis House and the Olympic Velodrome.Born in Poole, Dorset, Michael Hopkins studied at London's Architectural Association under tutors Cedric Price, Bob Maxwell and Peter Smithson, before joining Foster Associates (now Foster + Partners).At Foster Associates he was the project architect for the highly influential Willis Building in Ipswich, before leaving to establish Hopkins Architects with Patty Hopkins in 1976.The studio's first project was Hopkins House in Hampstead. The stripped-back home, which combined glass and a modular framework of mass-produced components, was a translation of the industrial aesthetic being developed by the high-tech architects to a domestic scale. The couple would go on to live in the house their entire lives.Following the Hopkins House, the studio continued to develop high-tech buildings throughout the 1980s including the Greene King warehouse in Bury St Edmunds, Patera Building System concept, Schlumberger Research Centre in Cambridge and Mound Stand at Lord's Cricket ground in London.In the 1990s, the studio developed the style to include more historical elements with Bracken House in London and Nottingham's Inland Revenue Centre both incorporating brick and stone.The development of historic high-tech culminated at Portcullis House alongside the UK Parliament, which was shortlisted for the Stirling Prize in 2001.Hopkins Architects remains one of the UK's largest studios and was shortlisted a further three times for the Stirling Prize in the 21st century for the Evelina Children's Hospital, Olympic Velodrome and 100 Liverpool Street – all in London.""With Michael the process was always intensely focussed and the conversation that led to the buildings always began as a voyage of discovery typically centred on establishing a sense of place, about how to make historic connections, how to put the materials together in an honest and contemporary way so that the building would appear calm and make immediate sense to the end user,"" said  Hopkins Architects principal Michael Taylor.""Nothing was ever taken for granted. It was a demanding and enlightening process and we all had great fun on the journey together. Whatever the demands of the moment Michael was always true to himself,"" he continued.""With this approach he changed the course of architecture in the UK and will be a point of reference across the profession long into the future. He was greatly respected both as an architect and as a person of integrity and we will all miss him enormously.""The photography is courtesy of Hopkins Architects.",and architect Michael Hopkins died aged 88 surrounded by his family. he was one of the early pioneers of high-tech architecture in the 1970s and 80s. he was awarded the RIBA Royal Gold Medal in 1994.

design,"Vestre launches ""world's first"" furniture made from fossil-free steel",Street furniture brand Vestre and designer Emma Olbers have produced a piece of furniture using fossil-free steel that was made without creating carbon emissions.,Rima Sabina Aouf,https://www.dezeen.com/2023/06/19/vestre-launches-furniture-made-from-fossil-free-steel-design/,2023-06-19,"Street furniture brand Vestre and designer Emma Olbers have produced a piece of furniture using fossil-free steel that was made without creating carbon emissions.The Tellus bench is made from steel forged by Swedish steelmaker SSAB in its converted blast furnace, which uses green hydrogen instead of coal for heat, and so emits no carbon dioxide.Vestre, which aims to be recognized as the world's most sustainable furniture company, says it is the first furniture manufacturer in the world to use the fossil-free steel. Steel is one of the brand's prime targets for slashing its carbon emissions.""Early estimates show that converting all our steel to fossil-free could reduce our overall footprint by around 60 percent,"" said Vestre chief sustainability officer Øyvind Bjørnstad.For designer Olbers, the goal was to lower emissions even further by using as little material as possible to make the bench. Even though SSAB's alloy is forged without coal, there are still carbon emissions elsewhere in the value chain, such as from mining and transport, so every gram of material still has some carbon cost.""An outdoor bench for public environments must also withstand a lot of wear and tear,"" Olbers said. ""We have striven to use as little material as possible but still maintain the strong construction.""Aesthetically, Olbers wanted the bench to have a ""metal feel"" but also look inviting, so she gave it wide armrests that would invite repose while providing enough space to rest a coffee cup.Tellus is intended for parks and other public spaces, and can be ordered in any classic RAL colour. The bench is titled after one of the alternative names for planet Earth.Vestre came to work with the fossil-free steel following a long-time partnership with SSAB. Bjørnstad describes the companies as having a ""tight dialogue"" on several sustainability projects.The Norwegian brand brought in Olbers because of the designer's dedication to sustainable practices, which Bjørnstad said involves being highly scientific and rigorous in her approach.The Swedish designer's previous work includes the Now or Never – 1kg CO2e exhibition at this year's Stockholm Furniture Fair, in which she visualised the carbon emissions of common materials.The iron and steel industries currently account for around five per cent of total global green house gas emissions. SSAB first announced its plans to make steel free of fossil fuels in 2016 and made its first batch of the alloy last year.The material has exactly the same properties as traditional steel but is produced using a process called Hydrogen Breakthrough Ironmaking Technology (HYBRIT), in which green hydrogen is burned instead of coal and coke.Green hydrogen is obtained via the electrolysis of water, which splits the water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen and emits no greenhouse gases.SSAB is planning to convert all of its factories in Sweden, Finland and the USA to HYBRIT and phase out its other steel products by 2045.Doing so could reduce the total CO2 emissions of Sweden by around ten per cent and Finland by approximately seven per cent, SSAB has estimated.Vestre's previous sustainability efforts include introducing CO2 emissions product labelling and reusing its old fair stands for new installations.Its production facility in Norway, completed by BIG in 2022, is described by the brand as the most environmentally friendly furniture factory in the world, with Passivhaus strategies, solar panels and geothermal wells.Photography is by Einar Aslaksen.","and Emma Olbers have produced a piece of furniture using fossil-free steel.

However, a lack of funding meant this was never realised and ultimately led to the decline of the building.According to the SFMOMA, its acquisition of Capsule A1302 reflects ""the architect's wish that the capsules not remain fixed, but rather move to other locations"".A total of 140 modules made up the 13-storey tower. Each containing a tiny home, they were bolted onto two concrete cores and prefabricated from steel.All of the prefabricated capsules measured 2.5 metres in height and width and four metres in length, with a single circular window and a built-in bathroom, bed and desk.Capsule A130, the unit acquired by SFMOMA, was once positioned on the tower's top floor. According to the museum, it has been used as a set for several films.In addition to SFMOMA's acquisition of Capsule A1302, the museum has also obtained nine photos of Nakagin Capsule Tower taken by artist Noritaka Minami. Collected from Minami's series named 1972, they document the building's interiors between 2010 and 2022.During its demolition last year, Japanese digital consultancy Gluon created a highly accurate virtual model of the Nakagin Capsule Tower, while Kurokawa's studio auctioned the rights to rebuild it in both real space and the metaverse.Elsewhere, Nakagin Capsule Tower A606 Project is currently transforming one of the building's pods into a ""mobile capsule"".The photography is by Noritaka Minami unless stated otherwise.","the Nakagin Capsule Tower, which was recently disassembled in Tokyo, has been acquired by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in the USA.

Swiss-French designer Alexandra Gerber is the only woman.Katherine Hoeger, CEO at Nine United Europe, told Dezeen that the current gender balance is not representative of the pool of designers that the company is working with.""We have work by some super talented female designers in the pipeline, but we had a limitation about what we could show in terms of what was ready,"" she said.Sam Stotesworthy, head of design and development for NINE, described it as ""an unhappy accident"".He said the gender split will quickly improve as the brand rolls out more products. ""By next year, we will be very close to a 50/50 split,"" he said.NINE revealed one of these upcoming projects within the Copenhagen exhibition.In a side room next to the main show, the brand showcased Sine, an outdoor furniture collection designed by Malin Engvall of Note Design Studio, which will launch in 2024.""It was initially intended to be behind closed doors, just to show to customers looking ahead to next year, but we love it so much that we couldn't help ourselves,"" said Stotesworthy.NINE's aesthetic centres around strong geometries, elemental forms and bold colours. Designs are developed with ease of assembly and transportation in mind, using recycled and recyclable materials where possible.Stotesworthy describes the style as ""simple, clean, unpretentious and perfect for urban living"".Gerber's contribution to the collection is Hook, a family of pendant lamps formed of two key elements.A wide semi-cone forms the shade, while a slender cylinder houses the fitting. The two are connected by a single concealed hook, creating the impression that the shade is floating.The range also includes 19 Outdoors, a range of outdoor furniture that developed from a charity project.Tom and Will Butterfield, also known as the Butterfield Brothers, organised the 19 Chairs project to raise money for Age UK during the first Covid-19 lockdown. Stotesworthy approached the duo after seeing the project on Instagram.""It's every young designer's dream to do a project, then have someone say they would like to produce it,"" said Stotesworthy. ""It's great that we have this platform that can do that.""Other key pieces include Bolt, a steel and oak shelving system by emerging German designer Lennart Ebert, and Skinny, a versatile wooden chair by British designer John Tree.""The Skinny chair from John is one of the most practical, functional products we have,"" said Stotesworthy.""It just ticks all the boxes in terms of good design and good quality; I think it really summarises what we're trying to do.""Nine United was founded by Danish entrepreneur Troels Holch Povlsen, who is also one of the co-founders of Danish furniture brand Hay.Hay previously sat within Nine United, but this changed after US furniture giant Herman Miller – now renamed MillerKnoll – acquired a third of the business in 2018.When asked about similarities between NINE and Hay, Hoeger said: ""Hay is a brand that we hugely admire. While both share a contemporary aesthetic, Hay covers such a broad spectrum that NINE is too small to draw a comparison.""The next steps for NINE, according to Hoeger, are to build the team out beyond product development. Up until now, the brand has relied on Nine United's business infrastructure to get off the ground.Stotesworthy revealed that workplace design will play an important role in the brand's upcoming collections.""We have some new products coming next year expanding into offices and home offices, which I think will show a little bit more about our direction for the future,"" he added.NINE was on show as part of 3 Days of Design 2023, from 7 June to 9 June 2023.

The blocks would be connected by a glass-bottomed swimming pool, which appears to be a similar design to a fully transparent pool that was recently completed as part of a development in London.One of the iterations has a more standard form, while the other has a structure that streps back as it rises. Both designs have a similar aesthetic with curved balcony overhangs and large expanses of glass.The design comes after the development company purchased the site of a 136-unit residential building called Champlain Towers South, which collapsed because of improper maintenance to its concrete structure in 2021, killing 98 people.""We are honored to have been chosen for this very special project,"" said ZHA director Chris Lepine.""While no work of architecture can ever remove the pain of the past, nor should it, a truly ambitious work of architecture can respect such a significant site,"" he continued.

For Vollebak Island, we have imagined the rooms as a manmade mount of individual volumes rising out of the ground and a separate outpost at the edge of the breaking waves.""""We wanted to bring their idea of 'hedonistic sustainability' down to the scale of a single family home,"" added Vollebak co-founder Steve Tidball.Ingels and Vollebak designed the house for Leader Island, which has been rebranded Vollebak Island. The team envisions the island as a sustainable retreat that could offer a ""powerful vision of how we might live on Earth in a self-sustaining way"".The island, along with Ingels' designs that have full permissions to be built, is set to be auctioned next week by Sotheby's Concierge Auctions.At the centre of the island will be the 597-square-metre home named Earth House, which consists of nine interconnected buildings arranged around a central courtyard.The living block will be made entirely from thatch, while the four bedrooms will be made of fire-retardant hempcrete. A boathouse will be insulated with seaweed and a star-gazing room will be built from polished concrete.Also connected to the home will be a greenhouse made entirely of glass brick and used to grow food for the island's residents, and a Japanese-style bathhouse containing tubs cut from the island's bedrock.""We've built clothing with everything from copper and algae to ceramics, minerals and graphene,"" Tidball told Dezeen.""But in clothing, there is a practical limit as everything you design has to work right next to a human body that's always moving. So when you move into architecture more possibilities open up,"" he continued.""In this project, we are looking at materials that are both cutting-edge and ancient – from bedrock and thatch to seaweed and hempcrete. There's a shared belief between Vollebak and BIG in the power of using innovative materials to solve some of the biggest challenges.""Alongside the main residence, the team has designed an eight-metre-high, triangular guest house on the island's eastern shore. Named Wood House, the two-bedroom home would be built from wood felled on the island.The houses on the island would be powered by a combination of geothermal energy, offshore wind and solar power, while the residents would grow all their own food. Tidball hopes that the island would be purchased by someone who wants to embrace a self-sufficient lifestyle.""Vollebak Island is designed to be an extraordinary man-made ecosystem where everything you need for life is on the island,"" he explained.""So we expect Vollebak Island to be bought and built by someone who shares the vision we've created – someone who would be excited to see all their energy being generated in full view by the sun, earth, wind and ground around them, and who would like to see their crops growing in their greenhouse and on the planted roofs of all the buildings,"" he continued.""At the same time, it is also a proof of concept for BIG's plan for the planet.""Tidball also hopes that elements from the project can be adapted and applied to other schemes around the world.""There are three areas that we think Vollebak Island really explores in an interesting way that can be useful for other future-facing projects around the world,"" he explained.""The first idea is that we're designing a family home that works entirely in harmony with nature – growing all its own food on the island, and using the ocean, wind, and earth around it to generate all the energy the island will need,"" he continued. ""So thinking about a small piece of land as its own entire ecosystem forces you to design in interesting ways.""""The second is designing an off-grid home on an island in Nova Scotia where the weather is very changeable, and you can have four seasons in a day. When you're not guaranteed wall-to-wall sunshine you can't ask solar to do all the work,"" Tidball added.""The third is how we're looking at in situ utilisation and using the abundant wood, rock and seaweed on the island to help create the structures and buildings of the house.""Founded in 2015 by Steve Tidball and his twin brother Nick, Vollebak designs experimental clothing. Recent launches include a near-indestructible jacket made from Dyneema – a fibre that is 15 times stronger than steel and a coat from graphene that acts as a radiator.The visuals are courtesy of BIG and Vollebak.","the concept of 'hedonistic sustainability' with clothing brand Vollebak. the house is designed for leader Island, which has been rebranded Vollebak Island. the island is set to be auctioned next week by Sotheby's Concierge Auctions."

""The winners of the Afri-Plastics Challenge are putting African innovation at the heart of solving this global problem.""Launched in July 2021, the accelerator program received more than a thousand entries that were whittled down to a shortlist of the 40 most promising projects, 60 per cent of which were female-led.The finalists, alongside the 31 other shortlisted projects, had already received £4.8 million worth of seed funding, grants and support throughout the duration of the competition. Since  its launch they have reported a 113 per cent increase in the amount of plastic being collected and processed every month.""We are awarding more than £4 million to businesses that are already doubling recycling rates thanks to the Afri-Plastics Challenge while providing new sources of income for families [and] pioneering companies,"" Dyson said.The biggest cut of the prize fund at £1 million went to Green Industry Plast – an initiative setting up plastic donation bins across Togo and training young drop-outs and women in sorting and recycling the waste to make building materials.Once the plastic is melted, it is mixed with sand and cast into moulds to create bricks and paving stones for the local community.""The Ecopave concept is an innovation designed to win over the minds of everyday people and persuade them to make more sustainable choices in the materials they use and the way they dispose of plastic,"" said the company's CEO Gado Bemah.Another £750,000 was awarded to Kenyan company Chemolex, which has developed a bioplastic made from invasive water hyacinths that are blanketing Lake Victoria.The Biopactic material provides an alternative to fossil-based plastics while creating an economic incentive for removing the invasive species wreaking havoc on the local ecosystem.Fellow Kenyan company EcoCoCo, which took home £250,000, took a different approach and instead focused on finding a plastic-free replacement for traditional scrubbing brushes and scouring pads.Competitively priced and biodegradable, the resulting pieces are made using waste coconut husks for bristles and handles made using wood offcuts from local timber yards and carpenters.""Plastic dish scrubs and sponges are commonplace in homes in Africa and are some of the most wasteful products in our kitchens,"" explained project lead Ingabo Schneidder.""When in use, they shed tiny fibres, a type of microplastic, which can't be filtered out by water treatment plants and end up in the water system. And then there's the waste factor because they are replaced often and are not recyclable.""Another winning project was Toto Safi from Rwanda, an affordable women-run subscription service that delivers and cleans reusable nappies.The aim is to cut down on the 7,000 disposable diapers an average baby needs before they are potty trained and ultimately save not just waste but also cost.""Many mothers in Rwanda just don't have the money to keep up with the number of disposable diapers they need, forcing them to cut back on basic essentials,"" CEO Faith Wacera explained. ""For some mothers, it can mean the choice between diapers and food.""Other winning projects include Mega Gas, Ukwenza VR and Baus Taka Enterprise from Kenya, Chanja Datti from Nigeria and Catharina Natang from Cameroon.Plastic pollution is at the top of the global agenda at the moment as the second round of negotiations for the UN's Global Plastics Treaty took place in Paris last week.Delegates from 180 nations and various other stakeholders were involved in the discussions to determine what the first-ever international treaty to regulate plastic production and pollution should include.But ahead of the negotiations, a number of NGOs and scientists accused the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) of excluding communities and waste pickers from developing countries, which are most affected by plastic pollution.Meanwhile, Greenpeace lobbied for the treaty to focus on capping and phasing down plastic production instead of treating recycling as a silver bullet solution, in a report outlining how recycled polymers often contain more toxic chemicals than virgin plastic.",and social enterprise Challenge Works have announced the winners of their Afri-Plastics Challenge. the competition's £4.1 million prize fund was divided among nine winning projects. the biggest cut of the prize fund at £1 million went to green industry Plast.

""Everything needed to be tactile, because toys are, above all, things you touch.""To recreate the almost monochromatic colour palette of Barbie's Dreamhouses, the set design team had to source a bottomless supply of pink paint to cover everything from lampposts to road signs.In particular, the production used a highly saturated shade by US manufacturer Rosco to capture the hyperreality of Barbie Land.""I wanted the pinks to be very bright, and everything to be almost too much,"" Gerwig told Architectural Digest.So much paint was needed, in fact, that Greenwood says the movie's production caused a worldwide shortage of that particular hue.""The world ran out of pink,"" she joked.Rosco later told the LA Times that the company's supply chain had already been disrupted when the movie began production at the start of 2022, due to the lingering aftereffects of the coronavirus pandemic and the winter storm that shocked Texas the previous year.""There was this shortage and then we gave them everything we could – I don't know they can claim credit,"" Rosco's vice president of global marketing Lauren Proud told the LA Times, before conceding that ""they did clean us out on paint"".Since stills for the upcoming movie were first released a year ago, the all-pink hyper-feminine ""Barbiecore"" aesthetic has infiltrated the design world, with Google searches skyrocketing and the term accumulating more than 349 million views on TikTok.Earlier this year, Barbie manufacturer Mattel collaborated with Pin-Up magazine to release a monograph on the architecture and interiors of Barbie's Dreamhouse to mark its 60th anniversary.""There have been so many books and entire PhDs on Barbie, but never really on her many houses and her furniture,"" Pin-Up founder Felix Burrichter told Dezeen.""So we thought it would be a good idea to make one and treat it as a serious subject, in the same way that Barbie has been treated as a serious subject over the years.""The image is by Mattel.","'s upcoming Barbie movie required such vast amounts of pink paint. production designer Sarah Greenwood says the production caused a worldwide shortage of pink paint.
