fintech,https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/22/plaid-unveils-new-collaboration-network-aimed-at-sharing-fraud-intelligence/,Plaid unveils new collaboration network aimed at sharing fraud intelligence,Mary Ann Azevedo,2023-06-22,"Fintech startup Plaid got its start as a company that connects consumer bank accounts to financial applications, but has since been gradually expanding its offerings to offer more of a full stack onboarding experience.And today, Plaid is announcing even more new product releases that moves the company into a whole new direction while also helping to diversify its revenue streams.At the top of that lies Beacon, which it is describing as a “collaborative anti-fraud network enabling financial institutions and fintech companies to share critical fraud intelligence via API across Plaid.”Plaid is launching Beacon today with 10 founding members, including Tally, Credit Genie, Veridian Credit Union and Promise Finance. Its argument for the need for such a network is that banks today already have access to shared fraud intelligence networks, but most companies don’t have access to the same types of tools.“The idea behind Beacon is that the vast majority of fraud that any one fintech sees, has been seen by another fintech before,” Alain Meier, former Cognito CEO and current head of identity at Plaid, told TechCrunch in an interview. “So essentially, what that means is that everyone is rebuilding the same anti-fraud mechanisms in order to try to catch what is frequently the exact same fraud, which means there’s a lot of wasted money and there’s a lot of wasted time.” Beacon represents Plaid’s effort to give fintechs a way to report fraud instances to each other. Participating members of the network will contribute by reporting instances of fraud, including stolen, synthetic and account takeovers, to Plaid. From there, they can then screen new sign ups or users against the Beacon network to detect if a specific identity has been associated with fraud on other Plaid-powered platforms or already within their own organization.  For example, a fintech can share that a particular stolen identity was just used to sign up for one of their accounts. When that same stolen identity is used to sign up for a different fintech, the business is able to “properly look at the transaction, protect the business and the consumers associated with that identity,” Meier said.Image Credits: PlaidImage Credits: PlaidBeacon is now available to fintechs and financial institutions of all sizes and Plaid’s 8,000+ customers. A business will pay Plaid to become a member of the network.The goal of the  new offering is twofold, according to Meier. “One, it’s to help the businesses to more efficiently and accurately find fraud that’s going on in their systems and to stop it from having this chain reaction of moving between different fintechs,” he said. “And then, secondarily, we also want to give consumers a mechanism by which they’re able to protect their identities.”It is also significant, in Plaid’s view, considering that regulators are giving increased scrutiny to fintechs, in an effort to make sure that they’re “adhering to the same levels of security and compliance that the banks have for many years.”Plaid spent about a year building out the product, which Meier acknowledged was a “a very hard product to launch.”When it comes to mitigating its own risk, Plaid says that it is operating the network with the same goal of securing sensitive information in the same way it works to secure financial account data. Beacon, it says, does not share personal identifiable information back to participating companies, only whether the identity information they are screening has been associated with fraud on other platforms. The company also emphasizes that is not used for decisioning, noting that “what Beacon does is offer customers an additional layer of fraud intelligence that customers can then use to do step up verifications or other security checks.”The company also last week announced a new feature called Remember Me, which gives a user who has completed verification of their identity to opt in and have their identity remembered the next time they are asked for verification.In January of 2022, it acquired Cognito, which offered identity verification and help with issues like know your customer (KYC) rules, and anti-money laundering requirements, for $250 million. The company then moved into offerings related to what it called “onboarding optimization” and risk and fraud mitigation.Plaid also made a push on the payments side, with products such as Transfer and Signal, which allow the movement of money and the evaluation of the risk of moving money, respectively. (It now claims to analyze more than $2 billion in transactions each month).“We’ve had really great success with having very high attach rates for our new products so we’re feeling good about our multi-product strategy right now,” said Meier.Got a news tip or inside information about a topic we covered?

Although the browser doesn’t have extension support yet, DuckDuckGo plans to add it in the future.The browser includes its own password manager that can automatically remember and fill in login credentials. DuckDuckGo for Windows can now also suggest secure passwords for new logins. The company says this functionality will get more convenient once it launches private syncing across devices, which will allow users to sync their bookmarks and saved passwords between different devices.“DuckDuckGo for Windows is equipped with our privacy-protecting alternative to ad blockers: the browser blocks invasive trackers before they load, effectively eliminating ads that rely on that creepy tracking,” the company wrote in a blog post. “(Because so many ads work that way, you’ll see way fewer ads – if any at all.) We also remove the whitespace left behind by those ads for a clean, distraction-free look without the need for an outside ad blocker.‌‌‌‌”In addition, the browser includes Duck Player, which is a built-in video player that is designed to protect users from tracking cookies and personalized ads when watching YouTube. The company notes that YouTube still logs video views, so it’s not completely anonymous, but none of the videos you watch in Duck Player contribute to your personalized recommendations or your YouTube advertising profile. You can leave the feature always-on, or opt in on individual videos.DuckDuckGo says it’s working to bringing the Windows browser on par with its Mac browser, including improvements like faster startup performance, the ability to pin tabs, HTML bookmark import, more options for the Fire Button and additional privacy features.The launch comes as DuckDuckGo recently announced the beta launch of an AI-powered summarization feature, called DuckAssist, which can directly answer straightforward search queries for users. The feature draws on natural language technology from OpenAI and Anthropic, an AI startup founded by ex-OpenAI employees, to power the natural language summarization capability, combined with its own active indexing of Wikipedia and other reference sites it’s using to source answers.","for a clean, distraction-free look without the need for an outside ad blocker.DuckDuckGo for Windows is equipped with our privacy-protecting alternative to ad blockers. the browser includes an AI-powered summarization feature, called DuckAssist. the feature can directly answer straightforward search queries for users.","DuckDuckGo’s privacy-focused browser is now available for Windows users.

biotech & health,https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/22/omeat-beef-cultivated-meat-foodtech/,Omeat emerges from stealth with beefy tech approach to cultivated meat growth media,Christine Hall,2023-06-22,"Omeat, a cultivated meat startup out of Los Angeles, not only wants to be the next one to achieve similar regulatory approval, it believes it has cracked the code on how to reduce the traditionally high costs to scale production of cultivated meat that can run thousands of dollars per liter.The company, founded by Ali Khademhosseini four years ago, was developed at the Terasaki Institute for Biomedical Innovation. Prior to starting Omeat, Khademhosseini was growing human tissues for medical applications after studying at MIT. As he learned more about animal agricultural practices, he shifted his focus to developing a scalable method for growing cultivated meat.Omeat has a patent-pending technological approach that “enables the cultivation of any meat in a way that is orders-of-magnitude more sustainable and humane than the conventional approach,” CEO Khademhosseini told TechCrunch.He explained that the process uses regenerative factors extracted humanely from cow plasma to make growth media, which is a big driver of the high cost of cultivated meat, and why some companies choose to make their own.Plasma collection from the cows happens weekly and is similar to how humans donate plasma, Khademhosseini said. And not just from any cow, but Omeat specifically sources growth media from free-roaming herd cows that graze on its regenerative farm in California designed in collaboration with Kristina Horback at UC Davis.It is then developed into the growth media, and that one type of media can then be used to grow any kind of meat, including beef, pork, chicken or fish. Omeat is starting with beef.The company is currently building a pilot plant and expanding its team toward commercial readiness after raising $40 million of Series A capital in 2022 from investors, including S2G Ventures, Google Ventures, Bold Capital Partners, Tyson Ventures, Rethink Food, Trailhead Capital and Cavallo Ventures.Omeat scaled its current plant capacity to 200-liter bioreactors, and the pilot plant will have the ability to scale bioreactors to 2,000 liters and 10,000 liters, which Khademhosseini said are the sizes needed, based on global demand, to generate meat at cost parity with traditional beef.“One cow providing plasma weekly can create many cows’ worth of meat annually,” Khademhosseini said. “Our vision is to make this so economically viable that we will have lots of people from the existing food supply world actually encouraged to partner with us in order to raise profits and address the razor-thin margins that exist right now.”",", Omeat, is starting with beef.

ai,https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/22/acryl-data-raises-21m-to-grow-its-enterprise-data-catalog-platform/,Acryl Data raises $21M to grow its enterprise data catalog platform,Kyle Wiggers,2023-06-22,"That’s the shared thesis of Shirshanka Das and Swaroop Jagadish, at least, the co-founders of Acryl Data, a startup providing tools to help companies organize and ostensibly better manage their data. Acryl today announced that it raised $21 million in a Series A round led by 8VC with participation from Sherpalo Ventures and Guillermo Rauch, founder and CEO of Vercel, bringing its total raised to $30 million.Prior to launching Acryl Data, Das was a principal staff software engineer at LinkedIn and, before that, a member of the technicals teams first at PayPal and then at Yahoo! (full disclosure: TechCrunch’s owner). Jagadish came to Acryl by way of Airbnb as well as LinkedIn and Yahoo!“Acryl Data is a community-driven metadata platform that delivers central controls across the decentralized data stack,” Jagadish, the CTO, told TechCrunch in an email interview. “With a mission to bring clarity to data, Acryl offers a data catalog with solutions for data discovery, governance, lineage and observability.”What exactly is a data catalog? Well, it’s an inventory of data assets in an organization. Data catalogs consist of metadata in which definitions of database objects are stored, such as base tables, indexes, users and user groups.Data catalogs are a dime a dozen — see startups such as Castor, Stemma, Select Star and Alation offer them, to name a few. But Jagadish argues that Acryl’s approach offers several key advantages over rivals.Chief among them, Acryl’s platform — which is built on the open source framework DataHub — operates on “event-driven” metadata. By only performing operations when triggered, Acryl can reduce the cost of data catalog maintenance while enabling a range of trigger-based workflows, Jagadish claims.“The explosion of data over the past decade has led companies to embrace a range of new technologies, but has created a fragmented data landscape as well,” he added. “Some problems got easier, like data orchestration, transformation, storage, movement and visualization — but other problems re-emerged as challenges, like data discovery, data quality and data management. Attempts to solve the problem — like traditional governance and observability tools — have been unnecessarily siloed, leading to further inefficiencies and inconsistent solutions … Acryl is designed to help teams move from simple data visibility to data insight, from insight to action and from action to automation.”Beyond this, Acryl offers an “observability” module designed for monitoring data quality in real time. The module, aptly dubbed Observe, monitors and attempts to spot data quality issues — in theory helping to prevent data breakages and drive faster resolutions where they do occur.Using Acryl, customers can also perform metadata tests, which surface areas for cost optimization, like expensive or underused data assets. The configurable monitors driving these tests let users define and continuously evaluate a set of conditions on the data assets in an organization.“Our most common ‘competitor’ is the status quo of custom development, as data engineers establish manual processes and protocols on their own rather than implement a more automated solution,” Jagadish said.Acryl has ambitious plans for the future, including AI features that’ll “intelligently curate” metadata and suggest business glossary tags and terms to more thoroughly document data catalogs. In addition, the company aims to launch an AI-powered tool to generate summaries that describe the key characteristics of a given data catalog, like its reliability and usage.Acryl, which has a 25-person workforce, isn’t disclosing too much about its customer base. But the startup did reveal that it counts Notion, Zendesk, Robinhood, OVO Energy, BetterUp and Riskified among its clients.Jagadish added that DataHub, which he founded while at LinkedIn and which Acryl’s staff maintains, is used by companies like Pinterest, Stripe, Optum, Expedia, Saxo Bank and Peloton. He’s optimistic that the features Acryl’s building on top of DataHub will convince at least a few of those to convert.“The fast rate of change in the data ecosystem presents a challenge for businesses and vendors alike,” Jagadish said. “As issues inevitably arise, Acryl increases productivity for data teams. Business users have a central resource to ask and address questions, rather than ad hoc processes for each issue, while data professionals can use Acryl’s lineage and impact analysis features to reduce time to resolution of data issues significantly.”","Shirshanka Das and Swaroop Jagadish, co-founders of Acryl Data.

Acryl has raised $21 million in a Series A round led by 8VC.","With the explosion of different kinds of data, companies are struggling to realize meaningful value from their stored data. Data teams are overworked, meanwhile — forced to cater to the needs of disparate departments within an organization while trying to maintain data policies consistently."
enterprise,https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/22/motherduck-launches-its-duckdb-based-cloud-analytics-platform/,MotherDuck launches its DuckDB-based cloud analytics platform,Frederic Lardinois,2023-06-22,"The promise of DuckDB is that as an in-process SQL-compatible analytics process database, developers will get the benefits of an analytics database without the complexity of managing it. Unlike databases like Postgres, there’s very little to set up and since it’s embedded in the application, data transfers are very fast. This makes DuckDB ideally suited for local data analysis. MotherDuck itself likens DuckDB to “SQLite for analytics workloads.”Image Credits: MotherDuckImage Credits: MotherDuck“As nearly every organization, large and small, strives to figure out how to get value out of their data, scale becomes much less interesting than making it easy to derive insights. While today is a momentous day for our company, it is just a first flap of our wings on this journey,” said MotherDuck CEO Tigani. “We’re confident that the combined innovation between MotherDuck’s platform and DuckDB Labs’s database will be a critical piece of how the modern data stack evolves over the next few years. Ultimately, we’re proud to be able to deliver on our vision to bring the power of DuckDB to more people. And of course to make analytics ducking awesome.”MotherDuck is obviously treading a well-worn path here. Launching a SaaS-based version of an open-source project is, after all, the current default to monetize these tools. The company is launching its platform at the right time, though. Even companies that aren’t focusing their data strategies on AI are increasingly aware of the value of operationalizing their data and while many of the existing tools focus on big data use cases, DuckDB — and MotherDuck’s serverless offering — also cater to small and medium businesses.The MotherDuck team stresses that this new offering also makes it easier for users whose data is already in the cloud to move to DuckDB.

startups,https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/22/heard-technologies-15m-therapist-accounting-tools/,Heard Technologies grabs another $15M to develop therapist accounting tools,Christine Hall,2023-06-22,"Victoria Li and Andrew Riesen started Heard Technologies in 2019 to reduce the burden from all of that back-end office work, like bookkeeping, taxes and payroll, so therapists can spend more time with patients.“There still remains a lot of opportunity to build provider-first and provider-focused solutions,” CEO Riesen told TechCrunch. “Much of the innovation has been around care accessibility or at the intersection of payers or employers. We’re building a solution that gives providers a bit more time and space back, both physically and emotionally, given the work that they do.”Solo practitioners pay $199 per month to be a part of Heard, while group practices pay $299 per month. Annual subscriptions are discounted. There is also a payroll add-on for $40 per month.Seattle-based Heard began in 2019 like some of those other companies — for example, Frame, Alma and Headway — helping provide access to care. The company had about 100 therapists paying for the solution, said Riesen, who saw this play out firsthand through his therapist wife.However, after seeing how difficult it was to even start a practice, the team spent 2020 looking at pain points and challenges, which included integrating telehealth as the global pandemic surged.Riesen explained that at the time, many therapists shifted from being part of a large group to starting independent practices, which presented new challenges of forming a business entity, tracking income and expenses, billing, payroll and taxes — things they may not have done before.Accounting tools dashboard.

Image Credits: Heard Technologies“We help them really understand their practice as a small business,” Riesen said. “Among the companies providing medical billing, electronic health record systems and care accessibility solutions, we’re slotted into that accounting back office, supporting them with those core bookkeeping, payroll and tax needs.”Heard raised $1.3 million in seed funding to launch its general ledger offering in 2021 and then raised another $10 million in Series A funding in 2022. In the past year, the company saw both its customer base and revenue grow by five times, Riesen said. Meanwhile, employee count grew from 20 to 35.Today, the company announced $15 million in new funding, which Riesen is calling an extension of its Series A round. It was led by Headline with participation from GGV Capital and follow-on from investors, including Footwork, Founders’ Co-Op, Act One and Heron Rock. The new investment gives Heard $26.3 million in total funding to date.With the new funding, Heard will tackle automation and scaling technologies as it also expands its offerings in the areas of practice formation, banking and retirement.The company also recently rounded out its leadership team with the addition of chief operating officer KK Mulligan and head of support Brandon Wolf. Heard is also hiring for a vice president of engineering and head of tax operations, Riesen said.“There’s a lot of opportunity in the accounting space to both improve and automate the annual tax filing experience and build on our core accounting features,” Riesen added. “Our ultimate goal is to be the financial back office for therapists in private practice. We’ve also seen a lot of requests from our clinicians around financial planning and retirement planning, so we’re spending time on delivering a more effective and seamless solution there.”",",,,, and revenue grew from 20 to 35.Today, the company announced $15 million in new funding, which Riesen said was a success.

enterprise,https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/22/limble-raises-58m-at-a-450m-valuation-to-help-orgs-track-and-maintain-dumb-physical-assets/,Limble raises $58M at a $450M valuation to help orgs track and maintain ‘dumb’ physical assets,Ingrid Lunden,2023-06-22,"But what about the vast swathe of physical assets and environments that are not connected, and may not be for some years to come? Today, a startup called Limble — which has built a platform to track various ‘dumb’ and unconnected physical assets for businesses — is announcing $58 million in funding, money that it will be using to continue expanding the business.Goldman Sachs Growth Equity is leading this Series B and it appears to be the sole backer in the round. Limble has confirmed that its post-money valuation is now $450 million.This is, especially in the current market, a significant jump on its last valuation. The company last raised funding, an extension of its Series A, just nine months ago, in September 2022. At that time, per PitchBook data, its valuation was just $170 million.But with revenue growth of 130% in the last year, and a list of customers that includes DHL Global Forwarding, Holiday Inn, L’Oréal, McDonald’s, Nike, Pepsi, RiteAide and Unilever, you can see why investors might be very interested now.Also notable is the company’s resourcefulness: Limble has been around for nearly a decade (founded: 2015) and in that time, the company had raised just $34 million, with previous investors also including AlbumVC, which like Limble itself is based in Lehi, Utah.The sector of enterprise IT that Limble is targeting sites between two generations of how businesses have been run in the past, and are increasingly being run these days. In the twenty-first century, especially post-pandemic, you might hear a lot about digital transformation, cloud migration, and, yes, IoT if you’re in a sector that has a lot of physical assets in its operations. Everyone either uses a laptop, or a smartphone, or a combination of the two to improve communications and productivity. These devices are not just to help people organize themselves, but to manage and interact with the apps, objects and people that are also a part of their businesses.Business of yore is a very different beast: some might have had access to computers, but it was certainly not a ubiquitous, default  state of affairs, especially in cases where a business had a large population of workers who weren’t tied to desks. For those who were at desks or managing things from a desk, apps were more likely “software” on premises and not in the cloud, and those objects in the business were very much not connected.While we’re slowly all migrating into the future, the dirty secret of enterprises (big and small) is that there are still large swathes of legacy businesses that are still firmly ensconced in the past way of doing things. They may have thousands of physical devices, such as say air conditioners, on their properties, which are not able to maintained automatically.Limble’s approach is to build software that does live in the cloud, but is designed to help organizations manage the assets whose roots are in the older way of doing things: they’re not connected, and they may never be.The startup’s specific area of business is called CMMS, short for computerized maintenance management systems, that is effectively exactly what it provides: up to date software that helps businesses track all of their assets and ensure that they are all working as they should, with schedules to help its customers maintain a regular cadence to proactively check when items are due for regular inspections or service.The fact that Limble’s core business is tied in with dumb objects has given it a very big opportunity to pick up new customers: although cloud migration and digital transformation is most certainly happening in the world of work, there are thousands of companies out there that are not adopting that wholesale, and some not at all.Ironically though its leaning into legacy equipment also meant that the company found it a hard sell in its earlier years, not just with fundraising and convincing tech investors to back a business profiting off of “low tech” but also with businesses themselves, which by their nature would have been slow to adopt any kind of new software, with many resorting to basic spreadsheets, sometimes even on physical paper, to manage the kinds of schedules that Limble automates.“We spent eight years bootstrapped,” Bryan Christiansen, Limble’s CEO and founder, said in an interview. He built the first version of Limble’s software based on an anecdotal complaint from a family friend about managing equipment, and without any outside funding, he decided to build it while working another day job. Christiansen basically developed the platform and ran the business for 2.5 years before finally signing up his first customer.“I would even have called it a side hustle,” he said. “Side hustle implies you’re making some money. I was not.” It took another six years to start making more of a dent in the market and to gain some momentum. “Then things just went crazy.”The company could have continued without raising this round, Christiansen said, but it was proactively approached by Goldman Sachs at an attractive multiple.“It’s a pretty defensible and profitable market. Customers can stay with you for 15 or 20 years,” he said. On the other hand, he added, “there is no category leader” in what he estimated was a total addressable market of $5.2 billion annually when considering spend on maintenance. Although there are ERP businesses that offer some degree of equipment maintenance and management services, in many cases these are focused around connected devices and IT equipment. Others in the same space include MaintainX, Samsara and JLLT.“Mechanics and maintenance will be around forever, so that is why it’s a good space to be in,” he added. “Not a lot of VCs are funding moonshots as much as they did before. There is a lot of appetite for VCs looking for real opportunities, and we are a real business.”The  company’s plans include continuing to enhance the platform, which is based around a no-code ethos. Indeed, using newer tech like generative AI could further help customers build workflows and scripts around their inventory and maintenance databases.“CMMS is essential to managing maintenance operations, but the market has historically been filled with overly complicated, cumbersome tools,” said Brendon Hardin at Goldman Sachs, in a statement. “Limble has disrupted this market with an intuitive, user-friendly, and modern CMMS that streamlines even the largest operations, and fast implementation means customers see ROI within weeks. The product has proven its value with thousands of customers worldwide, and we are confident Limble’s market penetration has the potential to grow exponentially in the coming months and years.”",",,,,,,, and environments that are not connected, and may not be for some years to come?

startups,https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/22/soulcycle-to-offer-trainer-guided-virtual-work-sessions-with-the-flown-startup/,SoulCycle to offer trainer-guided virtual work sessions with the FLOWN startup,Mike Butcher,2023-06-22,"It’s now partnering with iconic exercise brand SoulCycle to bring its “energizing workout” methodology to the masses.SoulCycle-led focus sessions – called “Flocks” – will be available to all SoulCycle and FLOWN members starting June 26th.One of the most recognized wellness brands globally — best known for its spin classes that border on a religious experience for some — SoulCycle is clearly tapping into a new area where charismatic ‘trainers’ can motivate a group in a new setting.FLOWN already runs 50+ live focus sessions a week, led by their own facilitators, where professionals and students work silently together, on-camera, using a technique called ‘body doubling’.If you’ve ever preferred to work in a library, cafe or co-working space alongside other human beings, you’re doing something that comes pretty naturally, and is often more motivating that working at home on your own. Indeed, during the pandemic, many of us found ourselves switching on Zoom to work silently alongside friends of colleagues, just for the company.This natural behaviour has now evolved into a burgeoning new area for startups, and even now has it’s own nomenclature. So-called “body doubling” is the act of working alongside someone else, and is said to provides focus, accountability and feeling of community.This trend of virtual, guided coaching seems to be gaining momentum and is morphing from fitness and exercise (witness SoulCycle’s move with Flown) into other forms. Peoplehood, led by SoulCycle founders Elizabeth Cutler and Julie Rice, is poised to launch “gathers” where strangers discuss their deepest hopes and fears.Body doubling has also become popular over the last few years as way to alleviate the effects of ADHD, the rates of diagnoses for which have skyrocketed post-pandemic.Although body doubling has ben recommended to people with ADHD, others are picking up on the technique. FLOWN claims its subscribers report a “5x increase” in their productivity as a result of a session — although it was not to independently verify this claim.SoulCycle Instructors will now join FLOWN’s “Flocks”, injecting SoulCycle’s brand of motivation into the platform. These communal experiences can range from decluttering one’s home, to completing tax returns, or practicing an instrument.Alicia Navarro, Founder and CEO of FLOWN said in a statement: “In a post-COVID, AI-saturated world, there is a deep need for accountability structures that leverage real humans and secular rituals. I started FLOWN to bring these structures into how we focus at work, and SoulCycle’s approach was an inspiration to me at the time.”I asked Evelyn Webster, CEO of SoulCycle what the tipping point was that secured her decision to work with Flown?“When Alicia and I were chatting about each of our respective businesses it became quickly apparent that we share a common purpose – to help our community live their best lives. With so much overlap in our purpose – and at a point when SoulCycle was looking to more actively engage our community in ways that move beyond the bike – the partnership seemed a natural one,” she said.What does she make of this new “body-doubling” trend?“I think whatever helps people succeed is great! As I have learned more about how body doubling has helped many people gain greater focus and therefore productivity, it’s clearly a tool that works.

transportation,https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/22/kodiak-loadsmith-to-put-800-trucks-on-new-autonomous-freight-network/,"Kodiak, Loadsmith to put 800 trucks on new autonomous freight network",Rebecca Bellan,2023-06-22,"Loadsmith says its newly formed entity, Loadsmith Transportation, is the first freight transportation company built specifically for self-driving trucks. The Kodiak partnership is meant to serve as the foundation for the new autonomous network. Last May, Loadsmith secured 350 autonomous trucks through TuSimple, but canceled its order a few months later. TuSimple has had a tumultuous year, including several executive shakeups, large-scale layoffs, federal investigations and the loss of a deal to build purpose-built trucks with Navistar. TuSimple is also facing a delisting from the Nasdaq. Here’s how the partnership with Kodiak will work. Loadsmith will order the trucks from a dealership, and Kodiak will equip them with its self-driving system, which includes hardware and software, according to Don Burnette, CEO and founder of Kodiak. The trucks will belong to Loadsmith, and Kodiak will sell its self-driving tech on a per-mile subscription basis. Those trucks will operate on Loadsmith’s freight network (LFN), an ecosystem of predefined routes and freight hubs. Loadsmith will partner with shippers and act as the carrier, deploying its autonomous trucks on long-haul portions of routes. The geographic area of the LFN has not yet been determined, but it will eventually cover the entire U.S., according to the company. Meanwhile, when Loadsmith starts deploying self-driving trucks, it’ll do so in the southern states. Kodiak has already tested and run freight across the south, from Florida to Texas to Arizona. To ensure smooth delivery, Loadsmith will also facilitate human-driven trucks to handle local pickups and deliveries. “The trucking industry already commonly leverages ‘relay operations’ where a driver completes one portion of a route, and then hands off the load to the next driver to complete the next portion of the route,” Brett Suma, founder and CEO of Loadsmith, told TechCrunch. “This is the same concept that will be used for handoff between the human driver, who will complete the first- and last-mile, and autonomous system, which will complete the long-haul portion of the route. “Until all parts of the trucking journey can be automated, these human-AV team-ups will be essential to commercializing autonomous freight in the short term. Waymo Via, the self-driving truck unit of Alphabet’s Waymo, has developed a “transfer hub” model that relies on similar hand-offs between AVs and human drivers at hubs located near highways. Waymo has partnered with fleet management company Ryder to tap its facilities across the U.S. Loadsmith will work with a variety of industry partners, including Kodiak, to establish hubs within its LFN. Kodiak is partnering with Pilot Company, a petroleum company that operates truck stops, to build out an ecosystem to support autonomous trucking operations. The initial Kodiak-equipped trucks will be delivered in the second half of 2025, according to Kodiak. Neither Kodiak nor Loadsmith said when they hope to have all 800 trucks operational on the network. They also didn’t specify an OEM partner, but Kodiak says its system can work on any truck.

The network includes Genies’ Silver Studio, a DIY digital fashion app (still in beta) where users dress up and personalize their avatars.The developer kit also includes XR (extended reality) compatibility, which means the avatar experiences have the potential to perform well in mobile AR, AR glasses and VR headsets. However, at the start, the experiences will launch on mobile.“We think this is really important, especially in the context of Apple Vision Pro,” Genies CEO Akash Nigam told TechCrunch in an interview. “In 2017, when we were building this, we knew that at one point we were going to live in an augmented world. And when that did happen, any type of social or interactive experience that you wanted to do with your friends, whether it was a mini-game or some type of social network, or use case, you’re going to need an avatar as a prerequisite… The XR compatibility tech makes it so that any of these avatars or creations can spawn effectively and performantly in an AR world.”The new engagement fund and the developer kit are by application only. The first batch of developers to be accepted for the fund will mainly be college students and other beginners that are selected for Genies’ Developer Incubator, which provide mentorship and tips for how to launch their own AR experiences.The company will launch the first cohort this summer. Developers can submit their applications through the Genies website.“We want to be able to work hands-on with each of the developers to be able to cultivate their experiences through the dev kit,” Nigam told us. “We really want to make sure that people are leveraging these avatars in a way that’s going to be additive to the entire ecosystem…We want to make sure that we can incentivize them to build experiences the right way.”Nigam said Genies is selective about the developers they accept. The developers are required to have a few years of coding experience to fully understand the technology.“We have built it in a way that, over time, you can have almost little to no technical expertise to be able to create an avatar experience,” he added.Initially, the company plans on accepting hundreds of developers to participate in the million-dollar pool and be rewarded on a monthly basis. By early 2024, Genies will accept thousands of developers.“It’s really based on how many developers we can best support in the very beginning,” Nigam said.",",,, or social network, you’re going to need an avatar as a prerequisite.Genies will reward certain developers based on the level of traction, such as how many users are participating in the avatar experience, how frequently they’re engaging and how many users are interacting with the digital items within the experience.Genies introduced its developer kit in May, which gives select developers access to Genies’ full tech stack.","Genies, the Bob Iger-backed avatar tech company, announced Thursday the launch of its Developer Engagement Fund to reward developers that build AR experiences via Genies’ recently announced developer kit.

In April 2019, the social network changed its policy to disallow ads on NSFW subreddits. So protesting communities are changing their status to try and affect the company’s ad revenue and get them to listen to their demands.However, Reddit is stepping in with some of these subreddits and removing moderators. It is also threatening them with punitive action and asking them to remove the NSFW label. As noted in a report by The Verge, r/formula1, r/HomeKit, and r/HomePod had turned the NSFW label on earlier this week, but the admins asked moderators to switch them back to SFW communities.Earlier this week, some large communities like r/interstingasfuck, r/midlyinteresting, and r/TIHI (Thanks I hate it) enabled NSFW. Reddit briefly removed r/midlyinteresting moderators but reinstated them later when the community switched back to SFW.  The other two communities are currently archived as moderators were removed.Apart from this, other communities such as r/illegallifeprotips, r/self, and r/shittylifeprotips also remain in archived status.The admin account that Reddit uses to talk with moderators, u/ModCodeofConduct, said Wednesday that communities can’t suddenly change their status.“Changing a previously SFW community to an NSFW community in order to protest Reddit policies is inappropriate for the members of your community and not acceptable overall. People subscribe to communities based on the content at the time of subscription. Communities can gradually change as they grow, but this is not what we are observing and not in the best interest of the users being subjected to that content,” it posted.Despite this, some subreddits like r/birthcontrol, r/perfectlycutscreams, r/gameofthrones, and r/applehelp still remain NSFW.While thousands of communities went dark earlier this month, over 2,700 subreddits are still private or restricted, according to a tracker.In a recent wave of interviews, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman staunchly defended the company’s decision about API changes and said that the protests didn’t affect the platform’s revenue much.

startups,https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/22/bridge-2-technologies-is-making-it-easier-for-companies-to-find-diverse-vendors/,Bridge 2 Technologies is making it easier for companies to find diverse vendors,Ron Miller,2023-06-22,"Today, the company announced the official launch of the Bridge 2 Technologies vendor marketplace with around 500 corporations and 3000 vendors on an AI-fueled platform. It had been in beta for a couple of years.Founder and CEO Eric Kelly says that he has been working to bring people together for years, but at a diversity conference a few years ago, he became enamored with the idea of creating a digital platform where corporations could find a curated set of diverse vendors.It’s really about networking and communications. “If Slack and LinkedIn had a baby this is what it would look like,” Kelly told TechCrunch, but the platform was built with a focus on finding diverse vendors. “It really was the development efforts of the large corporations, the diverse companies, the leaders in that industry, saying what are the things that we need to do to actually connect everyone together,” he said.Kelly said the idea for the platform was born at a one-day conference in New York a few years ago, which brought together corporate leaders and the leaders from diverse companies. It went so well, they wanted a way to keep these groups connected.“As we talked about it, [the participants] said we don’t have a way of connecting in a meaningful way to find the corporations that are ready to scale, finding the talent. And so I raised my hand and said, ‘OK guys, I’ll build a platform if you help me build the ecosystem.’ And that’s how it started,” Kelly recalled.While many companies such as government contractors have a mandate to work with a diverse group of vendors, it’s often a challenge to find and vet them. That’s why it was goal for the platform to be highly curated, so that the corporations looking for vendors would be working with a set of companies that have passed some sort of diversity certification from a vendor perspective, and can handle the needs of a large corporation.“So that’s why it’s invitation-only. So when they go to the platform, they know that company has already been curated either by them or by one of the large certification bodies that they’ve already done business with,” Kelly said.The plan was originally to launch with just 250 vendors, but they are actually launching today with over 3000. Kelly said they took a very deliberate approach to building the platform, not taking any venture capital, so that they could take their time and get it right before launching.The AI on the backend helps deliver the right content to the right person or company, while translating and taking care of other tasks that can make the platform easier to use.While the platform is intended to help companies find diverse vendors, an altruistic goal to be sure, it’s still a for-profit venture, says Kelly. As such, both vendors and corporations pay for the privilege of being on the platform, driving revenue from both sides of the house. Pricing is still being worked out.",the platform was launched with around 500 corporations and 3000 vendors on an AI-fueled platform. the platform had been in beta for a couple of years. founder and CEO Eric Kelly says that he has been working to bring people together for years.,Bridge 2 Technologies began with the notion that it should be easier for companies to find a diverse set of vendors. The company formed three years ago with the idea of bringing these two groups together in a two-way marketplace.
privacy,https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/22/adtech-giant-criteo-his-with-revised-e40m-fine-by-french-data-privacy-body-over-gdpr-breaches/,Adtech giant Criteo hit with revised €40M fine by French data privacy body over GDPR breaches,Paul Sawers,2023-06-22,"The case in question dates back to 2018 when Privacy International filed a formal complaint with the Commission nationale de l’informatique et des libertés (CNIL), France’s data privacy watchdog, using GDPR regulations that had recently been introduced across the European Union. Privacy International said it was “gravely concerned” at the data processing activities of several players in the data broking and adtech industry, one of which was Criteo. None of Your Business (NOYB), an Austria-based non-profit based in co-founded by lawyer and privacy activist Max Schrems, also later added its name to the complaint.The crux of the issue centred on what Privacy International referred to as a “manipulation machine,” vis-à-vis how Criteo used various tracking and data-processing techniques to profile internet users for more granular ad-targeting, such as using prior online activity to predict what products an online shopper might want to buy — this is known as “behavioral retargeting.”Privacy International and NOYB asserted that Criteo didn’t have a proper legal basis for this tracking, with the CNIL launching a formal investigation in 2020.Fast-forward to August 2022, and the CNIL reached a preliminary decision that Criteo had indeed breached GDPR and slapped the Paris-based company with a €60 million fine. In the intervening months, however, Criteo sought to reduce the figure.In a summary document made public today, Criteo argued that its actions were non-deliberate and did not result in any harm. It said (translation via DeepL):The company believes that better consideration of the criteria set out in Article 83(2) of the GDPR, in particular with regard to the absence of evidence of harm, the non-deliberate nature of the breaches, the measures taken to mitigate harm, the cooperation it says it has shown with the supervisory authority and the categories of personal data concerned, which present low intrusiveness, would justify that, should the restricted panel decide to impose a fine, it significantly reduce the amount of 60 million euros proposed by the rapporteur.Criteo added that the initial fine represented half of its earnings and 3% of its global sales, which is “close to the legal maximum” allowed under GDPR. Moreover, it argued that the fine was excessive compared to other fines meted out by the CNIL to the likes of Google and Facebook’s parent Meta, which amounted to just 0.07% and 0.06% of their respective global sales.Thus, the CNIL has seemingly paid at least some heed to Criteo’s grievances and reduced the fine by one-third. However, Criteo chief legal officer Ryan Damon says that the company plans to appeal the decision, calling it “vastly disproportionate” when positioned against other alleged breaches elsewhere in the industry.“In addition, we believe that a number of the CNIL’s interpretations and applications of the GDPR are not consistent with the European Court of Justice rulings, and even with the CNIL’s own guidance,” Damon said in a statement issued to TechCrunch.The CNIL’s final report still paints a scathing picture of Criteo’s disregard for privacy, noting that the data processing involved “a very large number of people” from across the European Union, including the “consumption habits” of millions of internet users.In total, the CNIL says it found five GDPR infringements involving Criteo’s ad-tracking activities, including a failure to demonstrate that the data subject (i.e. the user) gave their consent, which is covered by article 7(1) of GDPR; a failure to “comply with the obligation of information and transparency (articles 12 and 13), effectively meaning that Criteo didn’t divulge all the ways it would process user data; a failure to “respect the right of access” (article 15(1), meaning Criteo didn’t provide users with all the data it held when requested; a failure to “comply with the right to withdraw consent and erasure of data” (articles 7.3 and 17.1 GDPR), meaning Criteo didn’t delete or remove all of a user’s data when they requested this; and a failure to “provide for an agreement between joint controllers” (article 26), which means Criteo didn’t have clear agreements in place with its partner companies that stipulate the role of each party and their obligation in managing users’ data.In its conclusion, the CNIL said that although Criteo didn’t have individual names of each user, the data was “sufficiently accurate to re-identify individuals” in some instances, which means that it was likely able to identify individuals by cross-referencing otherwise anonymized datasets with public records or combining other data-meshing techniques to infer the identity of users.And then, of course, there is the elephant in the room — Criteo’s motivations with regards to its main mechanisms for making money.“The CNIL also took into account the business model of the company which relies exclusively on its ability to display to internet users the most relevant advertisements to promote the products of its advertiser customers and thus on its ability to collect and process a huge amount of data,” the CNIL wrote. “The CNIL considered that the processing of individuals’ data without proof of their valid consent enabled the company to unduly increase the number of persons concerned by its processing and thus the financial income it derives from its role as an advertising intermediary.”However, Criteo is sticking to its original arguments, insofar as it says that no damage was ultimately done, while pointing to the fact that the CNIL has not requested Criteo to alter any of its current practices.“As we stated previously, we consider that the allegations made by the CNIL do not involve risk to individuals nor any damage caused to them,” Damon said. “Criteo, which uses only pseudonymized, non-directly identifiable and non-sensitive data in its activities, is fully committed to protecting the privacy and data of users. The decision relates to past matters and does not include any obligation for Criteo to change its current practices; there is no impact to the service levels and performance that we are able to deliver to our customers as a result of this decision. We continue to uphold the highest standards in this area and operate a fully transparent and regulatory-compliant global business. We will be making no further statement at this stage.”*This story was updated with comment from Criteo.","ad-targeting, such as using prior online activity to predict what products an online shopper might want to buy. Criteo breached the GDPR and slapped the Paris-based company with a €60 million fine. the CNIL launched a formal investigation in 2020, with the CNIL launching a formal investigation in 2020.",French advertising technology giant Criteo has been issued with a revised fine of €40 million ($44 million) over failings to garner users’ consent around targeted advertising.

In the US last year, Nichole Wischoff’s Solo GP firm Wischoff Ventures closed a second fund of $20 million. This year in Asia, AngelList alum Wing Vasiksiri reached an AUM of $14 million, for instance.The latest to join the Solo GP party in Europe is log-time tech scene player Robin Haak.He’s launching Robin Capital, which, he says, has now reached a first close of €3 million and is aiming for a €10-20 Euro final close. It will participate in angel, pre-seed, and seed funding rounds.The former founder of Jobspotting (acquired by SmartRecruiters Inc. out of San Francisco in 2017) was a first-check investor in N26 and has done over 20 other investments, including Frontify, Algolia, and Aircall. Haak was also previously a General Partner with Revaia Growth One.Robin Capital’s current portfolio consists of inaugural investments in Beam, Kombo, and M2.Haak told me he has a “network of hundreds of operators who are sourcing and servicing. I also have a value-add Limited Partner base featuring Fabrice Grinda (an early investor in Alibaba), Julian Blessin (Co-Founder of TIER Mobility) and Jerome Ternynck (Founder and CEO of SmartRecruiters).”Haak describes his fund as having a “focus on outstanding entrepreneurs, software subscription businesses, primarily in Europe, Israel, and the US”. It will be vertical-agnostic, and mainly Pre-Seed to Seed.“Our investment strategy spans Europe, the US, and Israel, informed by my direct involvement in these regions,” he told me via email.“I’ve helped build companies like SmartRecruiters in the US, Revaia in France, Jobspotting in Germany, Axel Springer in Israel, and Slush in the Nordics. As we are based in Berlin, it’s anticipated that the DACH region will continue to be a solid foundation for us,” he added.Solo GPs, if they timed their fund-raise right, can get pretty big.Last year, Streamlined Ventures, led by Ullas Naik, secured $140 million in new capital commitments for its two newest funds, bringing the total funds managed to eight with the assets under management reaching about $325 million.","a second fund of $20 million, for example. Robin Haak is launching Robin Capital, which has now reached a first close of €3 million. he says he has a “network of hundreds of operators who are sourcing and servicing”","If you were a Solo Venture Capitalist — or Solo GP as they have come to be known — during the 2020-2021 boom, you might be in trouble now, especially as valuations from that era have often tanked. However, while the Solo GP model has been around in the US for some years, this model of VC has arrived late enough in Europe for it to become a more viable way forward for many European startups who are finding thin-pickings from multi-partnered VC funds in this bear-ish market."
venture,https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/22/kubik/,Plastic upcycling startup Kubik closes $3.34M seed to scale production in Ethiopia,Annie Njanja,2023-06-22,"Plastic pollution is already a menace said to be altering environments, and endangering lives, but there is a glimmer of hope as the share of recycled plastic is expected to nearly double over the same period to 17% as plastic going through waste management systems increases.In Africa, Kubik, an upcycling startup with operations in Kenya and Ethiopia, is among the companies that are leading plastic waste reuse and sustainability efforts in the continent’s nascent recycling sector, which currently salvages only four percent of the waste produced.The startup turns hard-to-recycle plastic waste (polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene) into affordable building materials including bricks, columns, beams, and jambs, removing 45,000 kgs of plastic waste from landfills every day. The startup is now planning to double down on the production of building materials in Ethiopia before scaling to other countries within Africa, against the backdrop of a $3.34 million seed funding round, recently closed.Founded by Kidus Asfaw and Penda Marre in 2021, Kubik plans to scale production at its plant in Ethiopia later this year saying it has the capacity to build over a quarter million square meters of wall surface area every year.“This can build anywhere up to 10,000 affordable homes per year, for example. Speaking of affordable housing, there is a 300M+ deficit of housing units globally that are considered affordable to the poor. This is a $2T+ market we have an opportunity to address, and we are just getting started,” said Asfaw, the CEO of the company, which won Startup of the Year at the 2023 Global Startup Awards, and was also declared the leading climate tech startup in Africa at last week’s VivaTech conference.Investors that took part in the round include Plug & Play, Bestseller Foundation, GIIG Africa Fund, Satgana, Unruly Capital, Savannah Fund, African Renaissance Partners, Kazana Fund, Princeton Alumni Angels, and Andav Capital.“We are thrilled to invest and partner with Kubik on their transformative journey. Their purpose-driven vision, exceptional team, and unique business model – combining positive social impact, circular economy, and low-carbon construction – positions Kubik as a scalable and sustainable solution to Africa’s most pressing challenges,” said Climate Tech VC Satgana, co-founder, Romain Diaz.Kubik develops interlocking building materials, which include bricks, columns, beams and jambs, allowing developers to erect walls without the need for cement, aggregates, and steel. Asfaw says this does not compromise the building’s integrity, and that the strength of walls built with its products is at par with cement-based walls.He added that Kubik’s products cost at least 40% cheaper per square meter, and have chemical properties that make them safe, anti-flammable and non-degradable. Besides, he says, these products are low-carbon, with a greenhouse gas emission of “at least 5x less than cement-based products.”Asfaw says the materials’ affordability can play a role in bridging the current housing deficit that is partly driven by a growing urban population, and hefty costs of construction. The startup is driving this change even as global appeals continue for governments to introduce policies that lessen plastic waste, and encourage a more circular use of the plastics.“The world is urbanizing dramatically fast today, and cities are feeling the burden of unmanaged plastic waste, unaffordable living conditions (especially in housing), and the impact of climate change. Our company plays a role in addressing all three of these challenges through a lower-carbon, lower-cost building solution that removes plastic waste from the environment. We believe this is why there is a lot of excitement in our company and its mission,” said Asfaw.“We have a product that is transforming how we build sustainably and more affordably, and we see ourselves becoming a company that will continue to drive technology into the materials used for decarbonizing the built environment faster.”",", removing 45,000 kgs of plastic waste from landfills every day. Kubik, an upcycling startup with operations in Kenya and Ethiopia, is among the companies leading plastic waste reuse and sustainability efforts. the startup is planning to double down on the production of building materials in Ethiopia later this year.","The amount of plastic waste produced globally is on track to triple to over 1,000 million tonnes by 2060. The OECD report predicts that developed countries will continue to produce the most plastic waste per person, although emerging regions like Africa and Asia are expected to experience the fastest growth owing to rapid population growth, and urbanization."

At its core, Atlas attempts to present a picture of the current European technical talent landscape, incorporating the 27 members states of the European union plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway (collectively known as the European Economic Area (EEA)), in addition to Switzerland, Ukraine, and the U.K.London comes out on top both overall (i.e. ‘all disciplines’) and in each individual discipline (e.g. AI, DevOps, security) in terms of volume of engineers. However, Atlas comes at this from the perspective that cities with the highest talent volume aren’t necessarily the best place to go looking for specific skills. As such, Atlas shows the densest per-capita (i.e. per the broader software engineering population) concentration for a given speciality among the local talent pool, highlighting two-dozen cities across Europe and their respective density spikes in 14 specialisation areas.“So this is cities that are punching above their weight for a certain type of engineering specialism,” Sequoia’s European talent director, Zoe Jervier Hewitt, explained to TechCrunch in an interview.Sequoia’s Atlas in action Image Credits: SequoiaSequoia’s Atlas in action Image Credits: SequoiaFor example, Atlas data suggests that Dublin’s general engineering quality across all specialities sits at just 37% in terms of the number of engineers with four- or five-star GitHub ratings. But when filtered down to engineers with an AI specialism, this figure jumps up to 60%. This positions the Irish capital as one of the hottest places for AI talent, along with several other key hubs across Europe, which tallies with separate reports from recent years that positions Dublin as a top AI talent hub.AI talent density on a per-capita basis Image Credits: Sequoia AtlasAI talent density on a per-capita basis Image Credits: Sequoia AtlasA curious omission from Atlas is that while it gives a percentage of GitHub users in a city with four- or five-star ratings, it doesn’t do this at a top-level for the overall talent density of skill-specific engineers in the city — regardless of their level of experience, what their GitHub rating is, or whether they even use GitHub at all.Indeed, while the dotted circles serve as useful visual indicators of the biggest outliers in talent density — the bigger the circle, the bigger the talent density — it’s impossible to know how they actually compare to each other. How much higher is Dublin’s AI talent density than Zurich, or Paris, or Berlin, or Edinburgh? It turns out this was a deliberate design decision, according to a Sequoia spokesperson, who said that percentages wouldn’t do a good enough job of conveying the contrast between the densities, whereas splitting them into broad “notable”, “standout” and “top city” made it easier to parse the differences.Speciality densities Image Credits: SequoiaSpeciality densities Image Credits: SequoiaMoreover, it’s also worth considering why a higher density of engineers with a particular talent in one location is more useful than another city with a lower density but higher overall number. The Sequoia spokesperson said that the correlation between specialization density and the quality of the engineers, as defined by their GitHub star ratings, is one reason why this matters — evidenced by the jump in four- and five-star GitHub ratings for Dublin when filtered by AI as their specialism.“We see this pattern repeated across different specialisations,” the spokesperson said. “[Also], outlier talent density in a particular city means a relative abundance of available talent for a specific skillset to recruit from. For instance Amsterdam has the highest density of DevOps engineers, which means on a local basis it has the richest supply of DevOps talent. While London may have more DevOps engineers in total, they are in relatively short supply as a proportion of London’s overall talent pool, which may make recruiting them more difficult, particularly for early-stage startups competing against established tech giants.”Other notable tidbits to emerge from the research provided in Atlas is that Germany (Stuttgart and Munich, specifically) is a hotbed for engineers focused on robotics, drones and autonomous vehicles, while Gothenburg in Sweden is something of an outlier for systems engineers.Helsinki, meanwhile, is big for top gaming and graphics engineers.Graphics & gaming Image Credits: SequoiaGraphics & gaming Image Credits: SequoiaOf course, if a fledgling startup really is just looking for the high-volume hubs, they can use Atlas to pick out places that might not be instantly obvious, such as Madrid which apparently has the highest numbers of engineers outside of London and Paris across all specialities.Engineering talent hotspots Image Credits: Sequoia AtlasEngineering talent hotspots Image Credits: Sequoia AtlasUsers can also drill down into specific hubs, and see what the lay of the land is in terms of volume of engineers; primary and secondary skills; percentage of female engineers; number of accelerators; and the “tech ecosystem value.”While these various data points may prove useful, Atlas perhaps could benefit from proper data-sourcing. For instance, Lithuania’s capital Vilnius apparently has a “tech ecosystem value” of €9.3 billion, but without knowing from where this figure was derived, it’s difficult to know precisely what it means. In this instance, Sequoia did confirm to TechCrunch that this was garnered as part of its integration with tech data provider Dealroom, which defines the “ecosystem value” as the:…sum of the valuations of all startups in the ecosystem. Using estimated valuations based on most recent VC rounds, public markets and publicly disclosed valuations.However, it perhaps would be more useful if Atlas showed exactly where its various data points have come from, using little clickable on-screen icons.Sequoia’s Atlas: Vilnius Image Credits: SequoiaSequoia’s Atlas: Vilnius Image Credits: SequoiaWhile knowing where to find the best robotics or hardware or systems engineers is an important selling point of this tool, it could also be used by remote-first companies looking to set up satellite offices, for instance, or even base their entire HQ.The founder of one of Sequoia’s portfolio companies Robco, a German robotics startup that recently raised $14 million, apparently moved from Boston back to Munich because of its abundance of robotics talent. And this is the type of scenario that Hewitt reckons that startups, scaleups, or even big-tech recruiters might use Atlas for, which is particularly pertinent at a time when the remote-work trend is showing little sign of easing.“I think founders can use Atlas as a lens for things like ‘where should we put our HQ‘ or ‘where should we put our main office,'” Hewitt said. “I think the other use-case will be around how founders want to think about and evolve their philosophies around remote and hybrid work. I think it will help founders inform whether they choose to operate a fully remote engineering team or a hybrid. So we hope that it will be useful as many companies are trying to strike that balance of hybrid and in-person.”A year in the making, Atlas is available for anyone to use today. But all this leaves us with at least one lingering question. According to Hewitt, they detected shifts in attitudes toward remote, hybrid, and office-based working during the course of developing Atlas itself, which leads us to wonder how useful this tool will be, say, a year or two from now as Europe’s diverse and distributed tech workforce continues to evolve.Put simply, is the plan to make Atlas a living, breathing reflection of the European tech talent ecosystem?“I think we want to see the response from founders,” Hewitt said. “I mean, we think it’s a really great tool, and I hope it’s going to create value for lots of hiring teams. Whether we will update it every year, I think we’ll wait to see what the initial reception is.”",",,,,, this figure jumps up to 60%. This position the Irish capital as one of the hottest places for AI talent, along with several other cities. Atlas is launching a new online interactive tool called Atlas which, while built primarily with its own portfolio founders in mind, is releasing to the general public today too. Atlas meshes qualitative and quantitative methods, including a talent survey of 1,035 participants.","There is an estimated 3 million software engineers in Europe, depending on what report you want to believe, but finding the right engineers for the job in hand isn’t all that straightforward. London or Paris might well have the highest concentration of software engineers, but knowing what locales offer the best access to specific disciplines is an entirely different ballgame, particularly in such a geographically distributed continent such as Europe."

We covered Supercritical’s launch back in August 2021, when it pointed out that the carbon footprint of the technology sector had — embarrassingly — been proven to be greater than the entire aviation industry.The startup aggregates business demand for cutting-edge carbon removal technologies. So in a similar scenario to Tesla starting out with an electric sports car so that it could eventually launch a family saloon, Supercritical gives companies access to these innovative technologies which have the potential to scale far beyond just planting some forests etc., allowing this new wave of carbon removers to scale up.Supercritical’s marketplace allows companies to purchase so-called “fully-vetted and qualified” carbon removal credits, to the level of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) industry standard.The funding will be used to scale its offering to tech companies, but, as co-founder and CEO Michelle You told me: “We are continuing to focus on tech companies but also will use the funding to broaden the offering. Every company in the world will have to get to net zero emissions if we’re going to stay below 1.5C of warming. There is no way of getting to net zero without buying permanent carbon removal to net out the remaining emissions.”Clients for Supercritical’s approach include banking platform Tide, algorithmic trading firm XTX Markets, as well as Veriff, Multiverse and IMC.She pointed out that there is already momentum in the market: “Already one-third of global market cap have made a voluntary commitment to net zero via the Science Based Targets initiative. Every single business will have to buy permanent carbon removal so the opportunity to scale CDR by serving other verticals is huge.”Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) refers to approaches that remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. The alternative, carbon offsets, has frequently been found to be at best ineffective, and even fraudulent, at its worst.In June an investigation by the Guardian newspaper, the German weekly Die Zeit and SourceMaterial, found that more than 90% of rainforest carbon offsets by the largest global certifier, Verra, were allegedly worthless.By contrast, Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) offsets are the only offsets recognized internationally that count toward net zero, by actually taking carbon out of the atmosphere and storing it away permanently.However, CDR capacity is disappointing to date, to put it mildly. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) found that only around 600,000 tonnes of CDR were purchased in 2022 — less than 0.01% of the 10 gigatonnes which we need to take out of the atmosphere annually by 2050.As a marketplace, Supercritical says it focuses on “high-quality, vetted, durable CDR projects,” including biochar, direct air capture (DAC) and enhanced weathering, as well as afforestation. Because it aggregates demand from buyers, Supercritical says it acts as a market-maker, which means CDR projects can then scale up. It also buys from cutting-edge climate startups (see the Tesla analogy above) which have new approaches to sequestering CO2.This last May, Supercritical went into a long-term agreement with Carbo Culture, a startup that converts carbon-containing biomass into biochar at a commercial scale. In 2021, Carbo Culture raised $6.2 million in a seed financing round led by Silicon Valley VC True Ventures.In a statement, Paul Murphy, partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners said: “Supercritical is doing something unique. By focusing exclusively on carbon removal offsets, they are helping businesses invest in the places that will actually deliver climate impact while they work in parallel to decarbonize.”Supercritical is backed by Lightspeed Venture Partners, GreenCode Ventures and MMC Ventures. It was previously backed by LocalGlobe and angel investors including Peter Reinhardt (Twilio Segment and Charm Industrial), Yancey Strickler (Kickstarter), Alice Bentinck (Entrepreneur First), Gustaf Alströmer (Y Combinator) and Evelyn Bourke (Bupa).The market for startups either taking a marketplace or a market-maker approach is heating up. In May, I reported on climate startup CUR8, which had raised $6.5 million from GV for its market-making platform for carbon removals. While Supercritical is both a marketplace and does carbon accounting and removal sales, CUR8 only focuses on removals and driving demand and access to finance for the suppliers.The fact that both these startups have come out of the U.K. is also testament to the fact that the U.K. is seen to be leading the way internationally on carbon pricing and regulation.","the carbon footprint of the technology sector had — embarrassingly — been proven to be greater than the entire aviation industry.
