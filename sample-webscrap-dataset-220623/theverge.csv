Microsoft case.,Tom Warren,"a senior editor covering Microsoft, PC gaming, console, and tech. He founded WinRumors, a site dedicated to Microsoft news, before joining The Verge in 2012.",2023-06-22,"We’re only minutes into the FTC v. Microsoft hearing, and we’ve already had a bombshell revelation. Sony’s PlayStation chief, Jim Ryan, believed that Microsoft’s proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard wasn’t about locking games as Xbox exclusives, according to a newly unsealed email. Microsoft counsel revealed the exchange between Ryan and a former Sony CEO discussing the announcement of the deal last year.“It is not an exclusivity play at all,” said Ryan. “They’re thinking bigger than that and they have the cash to make moves like this. I’ve spent a fair amount of time with [Phil] Spencer Bobby [Kotick] and I’m pretty sure we will continue to see Call of Duty on PlayStation for years to come.”The surprise revelation runs counter to Sony’s arguments against Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard deal and its filings with regulators. Sony has maintained it fears Microsoft could make Call of Duty exclusive to Xbox or even sabotage the PlayStation versions of the game.Ryan went on to say, “We have some good stuff cooking. I’m not complacent, I’d rather this didn’t happen, but we’ll be OK, we’ll be more than OK.”Microsoft initially offered Call of Duty on PlayStation for three years after the current agreement between Activision and Sony ends. Ryan called that offer “inadequate on many levels.” Microsoft eventually offered Sony a 10-year deal for Call of Duty on PlayStation, but the company has refused to sign this so far.Call of Duty competition fears were initially a big part of the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) investigation before the regulator dropped the console concerns and ended up blocking the deal due to cloud market competition concerns. The European Commission also dismissed concerns about Call of Duty or Xbox exclusive games, but the FTC’s case is largely focused on the potential harm of Microsoft turning Activision games into Xbox exclusives across console, cloud gaming, and multi-game subscriptions.",", but we’re only minutes into the FTC v.

"twitch, creators, tech",Twitch is going to let you pay to pin posts in chat ,https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/22/23769055/twitch-hype-chats-pay-pin-posts," If you’ve seen YouTube’s Super Chats, Hype Chats are pretty similar.",Jay Peters,"a news editor who writes about technology, video games, and virtual worlds. He’s submitted several accepted emoji proposals to the Unicode Consortium.",2023-06-22,"Twitch is introducing a new feature, Hype Chat, that lets users pay to pin messages at the top of a streamer’s chat feed.If you’ve seen YouTube’s Super Chats, which the company first announced in 2017, then Hype Chats should look pretty familiar. Streamers will be able to set how much Hype Chats cost (with a minimum of up to $100 and a maximum of up to $500), and based on how much you pay, you’ll have a better-looking chat. “Higher value Hype Chats will stay at the top of chat longer, have longer allowed character counts, and have more standout designs,” Twitch said in a blog post. Right now, the feature is only available on the web, Twitch spokesperson Adiya Taylor tells The Verge.Depending on how many Hype Chats a streamer gets, they could prove to be lucrative. Twitch is offering a 70 percent revenue split of net payment costs on the web for purchases of Hype Chats.That said, there are pretty obvious ways a bad actor could pay for Hype Chats to harass a streamer. To prevent situations like that, Twitch put a few safety features in place: viewers cannot send Hype Chat messages with banned words or phrases, for example, and Hype Chats from timed out or banned users will be removed. Streamers and their mods can also unpin Hype Chats if they want. But Taylor says that streamers who have Hype Chat (to start, Twitch partners) will not be able to opt out.Hype Chats add to a growing list of ways viewers can directly support streamers, including subscribing, gifting subs, and tipping with Bits. However, many partnered streamers still only receive 50 percent of their subscription revenue, though Twitch has spelled out the requirements for the “Partner Plus” program that makes you eligible for 70 percent of revenues starting in October. And we’ll have to wait and see if features like Hype Chats and the Partner Plus program are enough to keep streamers around; xQc and Amouranth, two hugely-popular streamers, just signed major deals to stream on Kick.","Twitch is introducing a new feature, Hype Chat, that lets users pay to pin messages at the top of a streamer’s chat feed.

"gaming, entertainment, playstation",An infamous Final Fantasy XIV monster returns in Final Fantasy XVI ,https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/22/23769740/final-fantasy-xvi-hunt-board-dread-comet, Return of the Red Choctober,Ash Parrish,"a reporter who has covered the business, culture, and communities of video games for seven years. Previously, she worked at Kotaku.",2023-06-22,"Final Fantasy XVI, out today, is stuffed with neat little homages and references to the Final Fantasy games that came before it. One of the game’s menus features sprites of Clive, Jill, Torgal, or whoever else is in your party if you’re nostalgic for the old pixel art from the game’s early days on the NES. When you speak to Harpocrates and have acquired enough lore, the old victory fanfare plays. But there’s one homage that’s more likely to inspire fear than warm fuzzy feelings.Red Comet is back, and he wants his revenge.Come with me back in time to 2020 when critically acclaimed MMORPG Final Fantasy XIV released patch 5.35 for the Shadowbringers expansion. The patch added typical post-expansion launch endgame activities, including a fight with an overworld boss called Red Comet, which, at first blush, just looked like a spicy chocobo.But he was a killing machine.Red Comet was uncharacteristically powerful and vicious for one of creation’s mildest and most beloved fake creatures, armed with moves that could wipe out high-level players. Naturally, in response, the memes poured in.Even the official Final Fantasy XIV Twitter account got in on the jokes.Fast forward three years, and the Red Comet has made a triumphant return. In Final Fantasy XVI, the hunt board returns, giving players the chance to hunt and fight unique creatures for special rewards. Though XIV calls it Dread Comet, it seems pretty obvious where the inspiration for this bird came from.I actually stumbled upon him by chance during a bit of exploring. One of the fun — and by fun, I mean sometimes frustrating — things about FFXVI is that depending on where you are or what you’re doing, the game will suddenly take away control to put you in a cutscene.That’s fine when you’re expecting it because you’ve hit the next bit of story, but I was out in the middle of the desert on some fetch quest or another, minding my own business. Suddenly, I’m in a cutscene. The music cued up. I heard a chocobo’s famous “KWEH!” cry; then the screen flashes, showing me my enemy.Seeing that it was an A-ranked mark, I — recalling the horror stories from this bird’s infamous namesake — thought to nope the hell out. But I decided to at least try to test my mettle against it and found it was surprisingly easy to beat, disappointingly so.Maybe FFXVI’s developers, some of whom, including producer Naoki Yoshida, worked on FFXIV, decided to make this bird easier to beat as an apology for Red Comet’s viciousness. Either way, I appreciate the neat little homage to one of the franchise’s deadliest birds.","FFXVI, out today, is stuffed with neat little homages and references to the Final Fantasy games that came before it.

"creators, tech, chromebook",Google is making it easier for students to access Adobe Express on Chromebooks ,https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/22/23769026/google-chromeos-adobe-express-integration, The new integration will allow schools to pin the program to the ChromeOS shelf.,Monica Chin,a senior reviewer covering laptops and other gadgets. Monica was a writer for Tom's Guide and Business Insider before joining The Verge in 2020.,2023-06-22,"Google has announced a new integration with Adobe that will allow schools to easily distribute the Adobe Express platform on student Chromebooks.Adobe Express is a free, cloud-based design application that provides basic content creation tools for graphics, videos, and the like. Google hopes that students and teachers will use the software to incorporate more digital art into their assignments.“I’ve got three children, and one of my favorite activities every year is the science fair in the gymnasium,” says John Maletis, Google’s VP of ChromeOS product, engineering, and UX. “I envision an Adobe Express-powered science fair where you’ve got more immersive ways of explaining the experiment or the project.”Generally, licensing a third-party app across a fleet of student Chromebooks is a challenging multistep process requiring purchase orders, roster updates, and the like. “It requires a lot of perseverance,” said Govind Balakrishnan, Adobe’s senior vice president of Creative Cloud products and services, of that system.As of today, Adobe Express is available directly in the Google Admin console. An IT administrator merely needs to toggle it on in order to give a school, grade, or class access. They can also elect to pin Adobe Express to their Chromebooks’ shelf (which is its equivalent of the Windows taskbar).Teachers can also now assign, leave comments on, and grade Adobe Express projects within Google Classroom. Students can collaborate on Adobe Express projects, similarly to how they might in a shared Google Doc.ChromeOS is well known and widely used in the education space, but its lack of compatibility with certain popular third-party software that Windows users can access has remained a hang-up for some potential customers. The former has picked up several new apps in the creative space recently, including LumaFusion back in February and the Google Photos editor in March. The prototyping platform Figma also recently became widely accessible on education Chromebooks both in and outside of the US. The push for better third-party support has extended beyond the artistic realm: Minecraft left the early access phase on ChromeOS a few weeks ago.The Adobe Creative Cloud — the industry standard for content creation and a software suite generally assumed to be Windows and macOS territory — could help build the Chromebook’s case to teachers who want to assign creative projects. Handily for Adobe, a shelf icon could also drive students and instructors to use Express when they might otherwise have jumped to something else.Balakrishnan, though, hopes that the integration will inspire teachers to incorporate new creative elements into their curricula.He views the integration as “the first step in many that we hope to bring to market to make it significantly easier for teachers and students to blend creativity and productivity together,” he says. “For the longest time, we’ve viewed them as distinct pillars, and we’re increasingly seeing that there are opportunities to bring them closer together.”“We’ve just seen this shift in the way teachers are educating their students — they’re constantly looking for more creative methods,” Maletis says.The integration was part of a large slate of announcements that Google made at the ISTELive 23 Edtech conference in Philadelphia. The company also announced a number of other features for Google Classroom, including integration with its Read Along feature, sharable links to class templates, an expanded Google for Education App Hub, and more data controls and privacy toggles for Chromebooks.","Adobe Express is available directly in the Google Admin console.

"transpo, policy, tech",Heavy-duty trucks would be required to have automatic emergency braking under new US rule ,https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/22/23769791/heavy-duty-trucks-automatic-emergency-braking-nhtsa," Vehicles over 10,000 pounds would be required to come standard with AEB as part of a broader effort to improve road safety.",Andrew J. Hawkins,"transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State.",2023-06-22,"Semi trucks and other heavy-duty vehicles would be required to come standard with automatic emergency braking (AEB) under a new rule proposed today by the Biden administration. The announcement follows a similar rule for all new passenger vehicles proposed last month and is part of a larger effort to slow the increase in fatal traffic crashes in recent years.The new rule would require heavy vehicles that weigh in excess of 10,000 pounds to come equipped with AEB, a technology that uses forward-facing cameras and other sensors to automatically apply the brakes when a crash is imminent. The system would be required to bring a vehicle to a complete stop at speeds as low as 6mph and as high as 50mph, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said.“We have been focused on this rule making really for many, many years,” NHTSA Chief Counsel Ann Carlson said at a press briefing Thursday.Making AEB standard in all vehicles, both passenger and commercial, was included as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which passed in late 2021. Supporters called it an important step toward the broader goal of improving road safety and reducing the number of vehicle crashes annually.According to NHTSA, there are approximately 60,000 rear-end crashes a year involving a heavy vehicle striking another vehicle. Under the proposed rule, the agency estimates 19,118 crashes would be prevented, saving 155 lives and preventing 8,814 injuries annually.After a 60-day public comment period, NHTSA will analyze the responses and make any necessary changes — a process that could take a few months. Carlson said she expects the final rule to go into effect sometime in 2024, at which point a phase-in period kicks off for truck manufacturers. For the heaviest trucks, Class 7 and 8, which typically weigh over 26,000 pounds, the effective date is three years from the rule going into effect.Research has shown that current AEB systems are decent at preventing low-speed rear-end crashes but are less effective when vehicles are traveling at fast but still average speeds. The American Automobile Association (AAA) has been testing AEB systems for years and found a variety of common scenarios in which the braking technology completely fails to do the job as advertised.T-bones and left-turn collisions, which account for around 40 percent of fatal crashes, are still almost impossible to prevent using AEB. Likewise, many AEB systems are crap at stopping vehicles from running over children, and at night, many of them are basically worthless.",", the biden administration said. “We have been focused on this rule making really for many, many years,” NHTSA chief counsel Ann Carlson said at a press briefing Thursday. “We have been focused on this rule making really for many, many years,” she said. “We have been focused on this rule making really for many, many years,” she said. “We have been focused on this rule making really for many, many years,” she said at a press briefing Thursday. “We have been focused on this rule"
"google, tech, google pixel",iPhone is dumb and besotted with Pixel in Google’s latest ad campaign ,https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/22/23769713/google-pixel-ad-apple-iphone-best-phones-forever," Do it, Google. Make ‘em kiss.",Jess Weatherbed,"a news writer focused on creative industries, computing, and internet culture. Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews.",2023-06-22,"Google has found a fun new way to dunk on Apple with an ad campaign for Pixel phones that straddles the line between cute and cringe. The search giant has released five videos — under the campaign name “Best Phones Forever” — which depict sitcom-like interactions between anthropomorphized versions of the Pixel 7 Pro and some sort of iPhone Pro. And it kinda seems like the phones want to bone each other?Google has pitched this as “what happens when two phones stop being rivals and start being friends,” though the campaign largely focuses on the iPhone’s apparent shortcomings compared to Pixel phones — such as astrophotography, security, and Apple’s lack of foldable devices. The iPhone is basically portrayed as an outdated, inexperienced dumb dumb across all of the videos. It’s a similar riff to Apple’s iconic “Get a Mac” campaign but with phones. And some weird, robotic sexual tension.Each of the videos follows a similar format. The iPhone and Pixel “characters” take part in various activities together, such as stargazing, watching a sunset, and going to the beach (which may or may not be a date). Then one of two things will happen:The first is that the iPhone says something lovably stupid to depict its inferiority to Pixel devices (“You know, night sight. With my night light,” it says in “Seeing Stars” after turning on its flash to take better pictures of the night sky) before promptly dying — a nod to long-standing complaints surrounding battery life on older iPhone models. The second is that somber music rolls in and the iPhone starts confessing its jealousy over many of the Pixel 7 Pro’s features. “When I was your age, people were showing me off to their friends,” the iPhone laments in Google’s “Plateau” video. “Astrophotography mode, Call Assist, 30x zoom… you can do so many things I may never be able to.” And then it dies again.Throughout everything, the iPhone waxes lyrical about how rad it thinks Pixel is, and there are a lot of weird, cutesy “will they, won’t they” moments. The Pixel has to clamber on top of the iPhone to save its life in the beach-themed ad (i.e., the phone activate its Battery Share feature to recharge the iPhone), and at one point, a Pixel Fold replaces the Pixel 7 Pro so that the character can “flash” the iPhone — opening up its brightly lit display like a sexy trench coat.Poking fun at Apple is a tried and tested method for marketing campaigns at this point. Samsung went heavy on this in the past, seeing particular success with its “Growing Up” ad in 2017. Google’s decision to dunk on the iPhone with chummy, lighthearted teasing also seems to have worked in the search giant’s favor — the reactions to these ads across YouTube, Twitter, and TikTok have been overwhelmingly positive so far. Sure, it’s slightly cringey, but the humor works, and it’s certainly memorable — truly an “enemies to lovers” kinda vibe, though I’m not sure what fanfiction category AO3 would need to file this under.","the iPhone is portrayed as an outdated, inexperienced dumb dumb dumb dumb across all of the videos.

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.",2023-06-22,"After creating the ultimate Optimus Prime toy, Hasbro and Robosen are back with yet another Transformers figure, and this time, it’s a 14-inch programmable robot modeled after Bumblebee. With a price tag of $399, this miniature Autobot can walk, squat, kick, lean, dance, and even pick itself up from the ground. But there is one thing it can’t do: transform.That’s probably one of the reasons why this Bumblebee figure is several hundred dollars less than its self-transforming Optimus Prime counterpart, which costs a cool $700 plus an extra $750 for the auto-converting trailer if you really want to go all out. But if you’re okay with the fact that this bot doesn’t actually do any transforming — or are just a huge fan of the Transformers franchise — you’ll probably still enjoy all the other cool things it can do.Equipped with 17 servo motors and 45 custom microchips, Bumblebee is capable of performing a variety of poses, with its ability to lean back without actually tipping over being one of its most impressive. If the Autobot does end up falling down, Robosen and Hasbro say it will “automatically get up on its own,” which is something I would definitely like to see, as my colleague Sean Hollister had trouble keeping Optimus Prime on two feet when testing the toy in 2021.Just like with Optimus, you can program Bumblebee to perform specific moves using its accompanying app. There’s no coding involved — you can either manually program Bumblebee by putting it in a sequence of positions for the app to track or you can use the app’s drag-and-drop interface to create a set of moves. Bumblebee can even perform alongside the $700 Elite Optimus Prime bot (or even the $1,000 Flagship Collector’s model) through a “mini theater” experience that lets you watch both Autobots carry out customizable stories and actions.You can also control Bumblebee using 20 different voice commands, like “dance,” “attack,” “pose,” and “open fire,” and it can even say 69 unique phrases from voice actor Dan Gilvezan thanks to its built-in speakers. Other neat details include LED eyes, working headlights on its feet, an illuminated blaster, and two walking speeds that adjust based on movement.If you’re thinking about getting your hands on this gadget, the Bumblebee G1 Performance bot is available for purchase now through Robosen’s website.","Optimus Prime is a 14-inch programmable robot modeled after Bumblebee.

Both larger and smaller sizes are on sale as well, including the 48-inch configuration, which is available for a new low of $1,249.99 ($250 off) from Best Buy and LG.In a nutshell, LG’s new C3 boasts the kind of impressive black levels, vivid colors, and rich contrast that have come to characterize OLED TVs in recent years. It also features a number of other welcome features, including support for Dolby Vision, AMD FreeSync, Nvidia G-Sync, and a speedy 120Hz refresh rate that gamers will surely appreciate. Plus, it features several new picture modes and more processing power than LG’s last-gen C2, which it owes to LG’s new α9 AI Processor Gen6 chip.The LG C3 is similar to its last-gen predecessor, the C2, but offers more processing power and new picture modes.

It's also lightweight, meaning you can carry it around easily, and it boasts more than enough battery life for a full day of work. Other useful features include a terrific port selection, keyboard, and keypad, all of which render it a great daily driver if you’re someone who doesn’t need a powerhouse in the graphics department.The LG Gram 17 is one of the best laptops for fans of big screens, offering a 17-inch display while still being surprisingly lightweight.

"apps, tech, security",DuckDuckGo’s privacy-focused browser is available for Windows now ,https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/22/23769084/duckduckgo-browser-windows-download," The launch means DuckDuckGo has a competitive, useful browser on all the major computing platforms, which makes its privacy-first case even stronger.",David Pierce,"editor-at-large and Vergecast co-host with over a decade of experience covering consumer tech. Previously, at Protocol, The Wall Street Journal, and Wired.",2023-06-22,"DuckDuckGo’s browser is finally available for Windows users. About nine months after launching its browser for Mac, the privacy-focused search engine company is bringing a very similar product to Windows users. It’s available now, and its pitch is the same as ever: DuckDuckGo is a browser and a search engine that doesn’t collect your data and doesn’t track you across the web.The DuckDuckGo browser looks and works like Chrome or Edge, with a row of tabs across the top and a large text box for searching and typing URLs. (DuckDuckGo’s search engine is the default when you install the browser, but you can change that if, for some reason, you care deeply about browser privacy but not search privacy.) DuckDuckGo does offer a couple of its own features, like a YouTube view the company calls Duck Player that strips out all ad targeting, tracking, and recommendations from a YouTube page. The team at DuckDuckGo has been working on the Windows app for a few years, the company’s product director, Peter Dolanjski, tells me. It took longer than other platforms in part because Windows development was new to the team but also because the Windows ecosystem is a uniquely complicated one. “There’s a lot of hardware and software variations, touchscreens and screen resolutions,” he says. “All of that just takes a long time to work through to make sure it’s working well.” The app itself is built on Windows’ WebView2 technology and uses the same Blink rendering engine used by Chrome and most other browsers.Adding Windows to the mix means DuckDuckGo now has a solid cross-platform browser that really can keep up with the Chromes and Edges of the world. The browser works on Android, iOS, Windows, and Mac, which gives DuckDuckGo a chance to protect your data everywhere you browse. The Windows app is still in beta, and it’s missing some features — most notably extension support — but Dolanjski says it’ll get upgraded fast.DuckDuckGo is still mostly known as a search engine, but CEO Gabriel Weinberg says the company’s vision is bigger than that. He likes to refer to DuckDuckGo as “the easy button for privacy.” “Search alone doesn’t actually solve the privacy harms people are concerned with,” he says. “Like ads following you around, unsettling targeting, or people grabbing up your personal information. Search is part of that, but there’s lots of trackers hiding behind websites.” The most complete way to help people browse the web more privately is to make a web browser — and the company has found that it’s actually easier to get users to switch from Chrome entirely than to get them to install a Chrome extension.Beyond that, Weinberg says he sees the gap disappearing between browser and search engine. You want the best of Bing? Use Edge. Google? Chrome. Brave? Brave. The browser makers are tying their services ever closer to their apps and making it harder all the time to switch. DuckDuckGo’s hope is that it can get people to do the one download to get into the browser, and then the company can provide all kinds of services. Weinberg and Dolanjski both say there’s plenty more DuckDuckGo can do to build a browser that is not only simpler and more private but also more feature-filled. Weinberg cites DuckDuckGo’s email protection as one example; Dolanjski says there are lots of other Duck Player-style tools the company can build. “Ideally,” Weinberg says, “these are features that protect you, that we can also make more visible.”But the first step was to build a good browser and make it available everywhere. Dolanjski says it’s close: the Windows version might be slightly behind while it’s in beta, but “the goal is to get to parity as quickly as possible.” Once everything’s up to speed, DuckDuckGo can start to dream bigger.",", but it’s still in beta, and it’s missing some features — most notably extension support — but it’ll get upgraded fast. DuckDuckGo is still mostly known as a search engine, but CEO says the company’s vision is bigger than that."
"gadgets, tech, tvs",Sky launches TV webcam for video calling and watch parties ,https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/22/23769585/sky-live-camera-satellite-broadcaster-watch-party-video-call-kinect-motion-controlled-games," The Sky Live is a new camera that’s compatible with the Comcast-owned broadcaster’s Sky Glass smart TVs. It also supports Kinect-style games, as well as interactive workouts.",Jon Porter,"a reporter with five years of experience covering consumer tech releases, EU tech policy, online platforms, and mechanical keyboards.",2023-06-22,"Comcast-owned British broadcaster Sky has launched a new camera that’s designed to add more social, fitness, and gaming features to its smart TVs. The Sky Live camera attaches magnetically to the top of Sky Glass smart TVs and connects via USB-C and HDMI. It lets you watch TV simultaneously with other households, supports making video calls over Zoom, can track home workouts, and also comes with Kinect-style motion-controlled games.Sky Live costs £290 (about $370) upfront, but it’s also available to buy for £6 per month on a 48-month contract, or £12 per month on a 24-month contract. But The Guardian notes that Sky is also offering introductory deals that bring the cost of the camera down to £3 a month when bought alongside a TV. The camera requires a Sky Glass TV to function, which itself starts at £14 a month over a 48-month contract, but scales up as you add more content to your Sky package.The launch of Sky Live comes as Xumo, a joint venture between Sky’s parent company Comcast and Charter is preparing to launch a new lineup of 4K smart TVs in the US this year in partnership with Element Electronics. The TVs will be sold under the Element Xumo TV brand, after Comcast renamed its earlier XClass TVs.“Sky Live makes your TV much more than just a TV, by introducing new entertainment experiences for the heart of your home,” Sky’s global chief product officer Fraser Stirling said in a statement. “Get active with motion control games, work out with body tracking technology, video call on the big screen and watch TV with loved ones – even from afar. And this is just the start. With our powerful Entertainment OS ecosystem, it will keep getting better with every update.”The camera itself is 12-megapixels in resolution with a 106-degree field of view, and has four microphones built in. It supports auto-framing to keep you in the center of the shot during video calls, and there’s also background noise suppression that attempts to keep you audible even when things get noisy. There’s no physical privacy shutter, instead you get a button to manually turn off the camera and microphone.The watch together feature appears to be Sky’s take on Apple’s SharePlay, allowing you to watch TV remotely with up to 11 other households, The Guardian notes. Friends’ video streams appear to the right of the main video feed. The feature works with all live channels and Sky’s on-demand content, but not third-party streaming services like BBC’s iPlayer or Netflix, and streams are limited to HD rather than 4K. According to WhatHifi, Sky boasts that playback should be synchronized across all call participants (important if you’re watching live sports together), and anyone can pause or rewind the content you’re watching. It’s supposed to emulate watching TV together in the same room, after all.The fitness and gaming features are where the Kinect comparisons become more apparent. There’s a built in Mvmnt fitness app with over 130 interactive workouts, and the Sky Live camera can keep an eye on your form and track your reps. There are also motion-controlled games including Fruit Ninja (obviously), and a version of Monopoly which is controlled with the TV’s standard remote and supports online multiplayer. But, as WhatHifi notes, Sky Live isn’t intended as a hands-free controller for the TV itself. You’ll still be using a traditional remote to choose content to watch.Disclosure: Sky’s parent company Comcast is an investor in Vox Media, The Verge’s parent company.",", and has four microphones built in.

He spent over 15 years in IT support before joining The Verge.,2023-06-21,"Mark Zuckerberg announced the Meta Quest 3 VR headset at the beginning of this month, which should bring enhanced capabilities for those who want to upgrade their Quest 2. But that more performant Quest 3 won’t be here until September, so in the meantime, Meta promised a future update will boost the Quest 2’s (and Quest Pro’s) performance and keep the hardware supported for much longer.Meta is now rolling out those changes in the v55 update. The Quest 2 will get a 19 percent GPU speed increase while Quest Pro owners will get an 11 percent jump. Both of the VR headsets are also getting up to 26 percent performance increases in CPU power as well, according to Meta.The performance upgrades should give users overall smoother game performance and a more responsive system UI, Meta says, and the company is also adding Dynamic Resolution Scaling that lets applications take advantage of more pixel density with consistent frame rates.Developers will also be able to update their games and apps to take advantage of the performance gains. Meta’s blog post includes a sample video of The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners enjoying a higher resolution thanks to the headset performance updates.The v55 update also has some new software experiences. The Explore tab now encapsulates Meta’s media content, including short-form videos and content from your Facebook and Instagram accounts, and as previously tested, Reels. Meta Horizon Worlds also has new places to explore, along with new Avatar digital outfits. The new Explore part of the update is rolling out “gradually” to users now.In version 54 of the Meta Quest software, the company had introduced notifications from non-VR apps, including ones from Messenger. Now in v55, Meta is adding a standalone Messenger app in VR so you can communicate with friends without needing to take your headset off and pull out your smartphone.Finally, Meta Quest Browser is getting multi-touch gesture support that lets you zoom in and out and interact with elements with not just the Touch controllers but also with only hand gestures.

"climate, environment, science",A first-of-its-kind climate trial just ended — will it work? ,https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/21/23768437/landmark-climate-lawsuit-held-v-montana-trial-whats-next, The first climate trial of its kind in the US just came to a close. The case brought by young people in Montana could break down barriers for similar lawsuits across the nation. But it’s probably going to take a while before its impact is felt in Montana.,Justine Calma,"a science reporter covering the environment, climate, and energy with a decade of experience. She is also the host of the Hell or High Water podcast.",2023-06-21,"A landmark US climate trial over whether the state of Montana is violating young people’s right to a healthy environment came to an early close on Tuesday. Its outcome could shift policy in a state with one of the biggest coal reserves in the nation and might even influence a slew of other suits outside of Montana.The case, Held v. Montana, was filed by a group of 16 youths ranging from five to 22 years old. They say they “have been and will continue to be harmed by the dangerous impacts of fossil fuels and the climate crisis,” according to the complaint filed in March 2020. Similar suits have been filed by young people across the US. But last week, the Montana case became the first in the nation to make it to trial.The lead plaintiff in the case is Rikki Held, a fifth-generation rancher in eastern Montana. Her family’s land and cattle have been devastated in recent years by the state’s increasingly dangerous wildfires. Unfortunately for Held and other plaintiffs, a provision in the Montana Environmental Policy Act bars officials from considering the consequences of climate change when permitting new energy projects.But Montana’s constitution also happens to include rights to a “clean and healthful environment” for residents and “future generations.” Held and the other plaintiffs contend that its environmental policy violates that right, and to prove it, they’ve taken the state to court. If they’re successful, they could potentially force the state to not only scrap the provision but start assessing the damage that permitting new fossil fuel projects could have on the climate.Climate change has already made wildfire seasons longer in the US, with fires breaking out more frequently and scorching broader areas than they have in the past. In her testimony, Held described how she’s had to cope with fires surrounding her family’s ranch. Her family lost cattle during a raging wildfire in 2012 — “They were so stressed trying to find water and, with the drought, trying to find grass,” she said. The ranch also lost electricity and running water for about a month because of the blazes, and it would face more fires over the years. “In the summer of ’21, there was a lot of smoke most of the days,” she testified. She remembers ash falling from the sky, towns nearby evacuating, and highway closures affecting her family’s business.The kids made a compelling case, environmental law experts tell The Verge. They spent a full week testifying to the ways they’ve each been individually affected by climate change. And they were joined by scientists who spoke to the harm that burning fossil fuels has on health and the environment. The trial ultimately ended a few days earlier than expected after the state rushed through its arguments on Monday. The state was initially expected to call on Judith Curry, a climatologist notorious for rejecting widely accepted climate science, but she never took the stand. The defendants also decided not to call on its health expert and several other government witnesses, according to the plaintiffs’ legal team.“As to the state’s case, it was a joke,” says Patrick Parenteau, professor of law emeritus and senior fellow for climate policy at Vermont Law and Graduate School. “They didn’t take the case seriously. They called it a publicity stunt.”In its defense, the state of Montana has argued that Montana shouldn’t be held responsible for a global problem and that action on climate change would need to be decided in legislation — not in court. “Montana’s emissions are simply too minuscule to make any difference,” Assistant Attorney General Michael Russell said in an opening statement.It’s an old argument that defendants have used time and again: that they shouldn’t be made accountable for the consequences of climate change if their greenhouse gas emissions amount to just a fraction of the world’s pollution. But this strategy hasn’t necessarily been effective. It didn’t work in the landmark 2007 case Massachusetts v. EPA when the US Supreme Court ruled that the EPA has the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act.“For the most part, courts have not accepted that argument,” says Robert Glicksman, a professor of environmental law at the George Washington University Law School. “I think it would be reasonable for the court in this case to say, ‘Well, if everybody made the same argument, nobody could do anything about climate change.’ And so as long as the emissions from Montana’s policies are contributing to climate change, that’s enough for us to be able to weigh in and issue a legal ruling.”Judge Kathy Seeley could take months to deliberate before issuing a ruling in this case. But Parenteau thinks there’s a good chance Judge Seeley could find it unconstitutional for the state to ignore the effects of climate change when making permitting decisions. “We’ll see, but it looks to me like she’s going to rule in favor of the plaintiffs — at least on this narrow ground,” he tells The Verge.Even so, that could be a short-lived victory. The judge’s decision is likely to face legal challenges regardless of the outcome. That would bring the case before the Supreme Court of Montana, which could be an even more challenging arena for the plaintiffs.“When it gets to the Montana Supreme Court, I think all bets are off,” Parenteau says. “[The plaintiffs] need to be strong — I think they are. I mean, I hope they’re prepared to lose because, God, you know, there are no guarantees in this stuff.”The plaintiffs in Held v. Montana are represented by nonprofit law firm Our Children’s Trust, which has supported youth in climate cases filed in all 50 states. Right now, only four of those suits outside of the Montana case are still pending. And the decision in Montana might not hold much sway over the outcomes of other cases since each depends on how courts interpret their own state’s laws. There’s already strong scientific consensus that fossil fuels are causing climate change — the question is whether laws are written in a way that might force a state to do something about it. Unlike Montana, most states don’t guarantee constitutional rights to a healthy environment.No matter the outcome, though, the fact that this case went to trial at all could push similar cases forward. “It’s been years in which Our Children’s Trust and other plaintiffs have tried to bring these cases to trial, and they’ve been turned aside or defeated or delayed at every turn,” Glicksman says. “I can see other trial courts being willing to move forward now that the ice has been broken.” Held v. Montana could make it easier for other trials to take place because courts now have an example for how to conduct these kinds of trials.A climate case youth filed against Hawaii’s Department of Transportation is expected to go to trial later this year. Our Children’s Trust also represents a group of young people who filed suit against the federal government in 2015. A federal judge ruled in June that the suit, Juliana v. United States, could finally head to trial after years of legal challenges from the Obama and Trump administrations.","in the case, Held v.

"entertainment, tv shows, film",Some HBO shows could be heading to Netflix soon ,https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/21/23768762/warner-bros-discovery-hbo-original-series-max-netflix," The deal, which could fall through, may be financially motivated.",Wes Davis,"a weekend editor who covers the latest in tech and entertainment. He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020.",2023-06-21,"After more than a year of brutal cancellations and layoffs at HBO, it looks like Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav’s devotion to quick revenue is as strong as ever. Warner Bros. Discovery may be licensing HBO Original Series to Netflix, Deadline reported yesterday. Deadline’s sources claim it’s a financial move HBO’s old guard disagreed with but that it’s necessary to shore up the bottom line. They also say it’s possible the deal may not see the light of day.The show rumored to be the subject of the agreement is Issa Rae’s Insecure, which lived on HBO for five seasons until it ended in December 2021. Other shows would follow that. The deal wouldn’t be exclusive; WBD would still be able to show the series on its own platform, Max.This wouldn’t be the first TV or film airing on two different streaming networks. Thanks to some contractual tomfoolery, you can currently watch Avatar: The Way of Water on both Disney Plus and Max. But this would be the first big streaming deal for WBD since it sold a package of canceled shows to free ad-supported television (FAST) networks including Roku and Tubi earlier this year. Those shows included the recently canceled Westworld and the unaired episodes of the Joss Whedon series The Nevers.While the owner of a streaming service selling content to competitors is unusual, for years, it was kind of par for the course. Back in 2014, Warner Bros. licensed some of its biggest shows to Amazon Prime Video, including The Sopranos and The Wire, and before that, it syndicated edited versions of some shows to TBS and TV Guide. It was only when streaming services sought to create their own fiefdoms of content in recent years that selling shows to competing services slowed down.But last year, Zaslav made it clear his company was “open for business” and they wouldn’t sacrifice their bottom line just to secure more Max subscribers. “We have a ton of content that has been sitting idly for just purely principle reasons,” CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels said at a Bank of America event last year.The current rumored licensing deal comes after WBD’s recent rebranding and relaunch of HBO Max as, simply, Max, which saw a new pricing tier for 4K video and some signs the rollout was rushed, resulting in an embarrassing credits issue for which WBD was forced to apologize as it lumped writers, directors, and everyone else under a single “creators” heading, angering striking WGA writers. (Disclosure: The Verge’s editorial staff is also unionized with the Writers Guild of America, East.)There are plenty of reasons to dislike Zaslav’s “open for business” approach, but being able to see high-quality shows like those HBO is known for on multiple platforms is rare as first-party content gets hoarded in streaming foxholes. And it’s a nicer story than a movie people put time and work into being canceled for tax reasons.","rumored to be the subject of the agreement is Issa Rae’s Insecure. Warner Bros.

"web, tech, artificial intelligence",Opera launches revamped browser equipped with an AI sidekick ,https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/21/23768888/opera-one-browser-aria-ai-assistant-chatbot," The updated browser comes with an AI assistant, called Aria, in its sidebar.",Emma Roth,"a news writer who covers the streaming wars, consumer tech, crypto, social media, and much more. Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.",2023-06-21,"Opera has launched Opera One — a new version of the browser that comes packaged with an AI-powered chatbot called Aria. Just like the Bing chatbot on Microsoft Edge, Opera’s AI assistant lives within the browser’s sidebar, where you can have it answer questions using real-time information, generate text or code, brainstorm ideas, and more.The built-in chatbot is powered by Opera’s Composer AI engine and connects to OpenAI’s GPT model. To use the tool, you need to sign up for an Opera account if you don’t have one already. Once that’s done, you can click the Aria icon on the left side of the screen to start chatting. While Opera first started testing the revamped version of the browser in May, now it’s available to everyone who downloads it.After trying out the tool for myself, I noticed many similarities to Bing on Edge — but also a couple of key strengths. One of the nicest parts about Aria is that you don’t have to open up the sidebar to actually use it. Instead, you can open up a command line-like overlay where you can quickly type in a question or prompt. You can also highlight text directly on a webpage, which opens up a menu for Aria to translate what you’ve highlighted, explain it, or find related topics on the web.Even though Aria can do almost everything that the Bing chatbot can, it still doesn’t quite stack up to the Edge assistant. Aria doesn’t have the same type of menu system that lets you quickly select a conversation style when asking questions and also doesn’t present any one-click options that let you choose the tone, format, and length of the text you wish to generate.You can still tweak Aria’s responses in these ways, but you just have to request it manually. Of course, Aria is still a new tool, and Opera will likely keep updating it as time goes on. Maybe Opera will eventually incorporate image generation capabilities as well, which is something that Microsoft has recently added to its browser.In addition to Aria, Opera One also comes with a couple of extra upgrades. That includes new “tab islands” that automatically group related tabs together based on their context, along with a new design and an upgraded browser architecture. You can try out Aria and the new Opera One browser for Windows, macOS, and Linux.","the tool, and Opera has launched Opera One — a new version of the browser that comes packaged with an AI-powered chatbot called Aria.
