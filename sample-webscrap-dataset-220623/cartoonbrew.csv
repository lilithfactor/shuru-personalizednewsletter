The house cost around $50,000 and construction took less than three months.In 2011, filmmaker Timur Bekmambetov (Night Watch, Profile) purchased the property and has since restored it. According to a Wall Street Journal report, Bekmambetov bought the house sight unseen and considers himself a steward of the property. Occasionally, it is opened up for public tours, often to raise funds for nonprofit organizations.Although Disney’s Homby Hills property is the more recognizable and extravagant property, the Los Feliz house is where Walt lived when the studio produced its first classic features including Snow White & The Seven Dwarfs, Pinocchio, Fantasia, Dumbo, and Bambi. It’s also where he raised his family.Clocking in at 6,388 square feet, the home has a distinct “Disney” look. It features a Mediterranean entry, a circular rotunda, and painted vaulted beamed ceilings as well as original stained leaded glass windows and a Juliet balcony. The home also has a theater, of course, where Disney could watch dailies or screen finished versions of the classic films that his studio produced during the years he lived in the home.The house has four bedrooms, three full bathrooms, and two half-bathrooms and sits on a bit more than one acre of land. The property has an in-ground swimming pool and enough driveway space to park 10 cars.It sits just one mile from where Disney’s original Hyperion studio once stood and is one of the few physical links we have to the early era of Disney feature production. The Disney Hyperion studios were demolished in the 1960s, and a Gelson’s supermarket now sits on the property where they once stood.",", the home has four bedrooms, three full bathrooms, and two half-bathrooms.

The first 2d animation winner of Pitch & Produce was the educational animated short Walter Precipitous, created by Canadian writer Toblerusse and produced by Portuguese studio Toma Creators.In this article, Toma founder and CEO José “Zez” Vaz explains the Pitch & Produce program from the point of view of a participant, and describes what Reallusion’s Cartoon Animator 5 can bring to the production process.Hi, I’m Zez. I’m a freelance 2d animator and director from Porto, Portugal, working remotely for over 10 years. I manage a small team of artists at my studio Toma Creators. At the studio, we handle the full production of animated explainers and music videos. Apart from commercial work, I’ve always been involved in personal projects such as creating animated series, podcasts, video games, comics, and more. I use 2d animation to turn my ideas into reality because I know I can do so with the right amount of artistic composition.Our explainer videos are produced for many industries, and our customers represent all types of goods and services worldwide. Throughout this piece, you can see screenshots of our work. Each partner we work with pitches us a story in less than a minute. Once we nail that down, I use Cartoon Animator to bring the project to life. The first such story on which I used CTA 5 was called Walter Precipitous.Walter is a water molecule. He changes forms from solid to liquid to gas, but most of the time we see him as a big-headed droplet. When I first saw CTA’s 360 head rotation tutorial with an Angry Bird sort of character, I knew Walter would look great with this software. I drew some sketches of the characters on an iPad using Procreate, putting them in neutral positions with all the facial features I would need throughout the film. I then moved the drawings to Photoshop, where I added color and prepared the models for CTA.There are a lot of emotions in Walter’s story, so I created two sets of mouths, one sad and one happy. The Crystal character was animated as a green screen body in CTA which we later turned into this beautiful intricate textured form in post-production using After Effects. The process of creating the characters with Cartoon Animator was fun and quick, and when their models were finished, animating them was a breeze.I typically use Procreate to draw my characters and then take them to Photoshop to add the right colors. Once I am done with the 2d character creation, I will move the model to Cartoon Animator for animation. In Walter Precipitous, there are a lot of lip sync movements involved. I know most facial animators, 2d or 3d, can find that troublesome, so I am glad that Cartoon Animator streamlined the process and made facial animation and lip-syncing easier with their intuitive built-in functions.When I finished with character animations, I brought them to After Effects, a software I was already comfortable with. Most of the background images and post-production were done using that software. This is also when I textured some characters, and I am very pleased that my past experience helped me to make them look more vivid.Cartoon Animator is already a handy software for both indie and professional animators. With Cartoon Animator 5’s latest update, we were able to utilize many new features and give Walter and Crystal more character. One such feature was the Free-Form Deformation (FFD) effect.This allowed us to squash and stretch the characters and easily create intricate effects straight out of the classic animation rule book. In our story, Walter is portrayed as a bubbly character with a dream to explore the world. The FFD feature truly helped us to animate Walter with an attitude to match his personality and created more cartoony motions.Spring Animation Design creates physics that were not possible before. On the project, I used Spring Editor to animate an otter, trying to recreate the bounciness of its tail motion. There are many pre-sets included in CTA 5, and I suggest dragging and dropping them onto your character’s bones to test them out. Reallusion demonstrates some in its tutorials, but sometimes you just have to play with them on your own to find the desired results.And lastly, CTA’s Vector Graphic files were a big deal for me, since so many of the illustrations I work with are vector designs. This also allows users to import any vector graphics coming from any other online library. Users can also get vector files from Reallusion or find free vector characters embedded in Cartoon Animator 5.Communication is key, especially on bigger projects. Our team has been working together for several years on a number of projects. I know what Mariana (illustrator) and Andre (sound designer) are capable of and their workflow. I know they both  often surprise me and push the envelope. Toblerusse, the creator and producer of Walter Precipitous, was a pleasure to work with. He was always understanding and gave us tremendous creative freedom.Even though Mariana, Andre, and I live in the same city (Porto, Portugal), we mostly worked remotely on this production and we’ve become accustomed to working that way. For communication to flow, I advise surrounding yourself with good people and try being helpful to your co-workers. Everyone involved on Walter was inspired by the story and had something meaningful to add to it. The big lesson was that remote work opened up a world of possibilities and collaborations that weren’t available to us before.Walter Precipitous was such a blast that the team is determined to keep going! So we’ve created the landing page Walter Teaches Kids for all upcoming materials related to the property. We’re producing more videos about water and science, a Youtube channel that we will be updating regularly, and a Teachers Pay Teachers profile with more educational material. Hopefully, new characters and new short films will emerge from this!If you like what you’ve read about our story but need a little help to get your project up and running, consider Reallusion’s Pitch & Produce program, which offers support for projects and pipelines.A project can be a game, film, animation, simulation, tv show, student film, or even a live event.

And that’s exactly what Ben Meinhardt has us doing with his latest all-too-real musical short Living the Dream.This super-meta short follows an animated animator as he smiles through the pain of bouncing from gig to gig and struggling to make ends meet. Presumably, the protagonist is Meinhardt, but the character will be relatable to anyone who has ever gone a week eating only Ramen while they wait for their next paycheck.There is a comedic disconnect between the short’s outwardly joyous protagonist and the dystopian nightmare in which he lives that is perfectly delivered. Everything is gray, the buildings are crumbling, the food looks like shit, and each of the background characters seems to be hiding a psychotic break behind a toothy smile.Meinhardt also made the brilliant creative decision to include sing-along subtitles, which creates a nostalgia for the Disney VHS tapes that so many of us grew up with. A tuba-heavy soundtrack is the icing on the cake.Meinhardt’s latest comes from a place of deep familiarity with its themes. He’s a 2d animator with two decades of experience and a resume that includes commercial work for giant companies such as Walmart, MTV, Hasbro, and Toyota, as well as stints on tv series including Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law; Ed, Edd n Eddy; and Kinderwood.Here’s hoping there is a good deal of hyperbole in Meinhardt’s cartoon interpretation of the world and, as he says in the video’s description, “this doesn’t age well.”","the world.

festivals,https://www.cartoonbrew.com/festivals/indie-animation-film-tv-production-panel-annecy-229849.html,Independent Animation Producers Share Tips On Surviving And Thriving In An Increasingly Global Industry,"Without billions in backing or decades-old IPs, these indie producers are blazing a path in tv and feature animation.",Ryan Gaur,2023-06-19,"With popular IP productions dominating box offices and tv ratings, surviving as an indie studio is as difficult now as it has ever been.There is no guideline for survival in the industry and in most cases, there are no government policies to fall back on if consecutive projects don’t find their audience. Being an indie studio means either trying to establish a niche and hoping that the market finds its way to it, or studying market trends and chasing popular modes of storytelling.With no one recipe for indie studio success out there, the Annecy Festival bringing together five representatives from global indie studios to discuss their techniques for survival was significant. Sharing their insights were Jose Carlos Garcia de Letona of Ánima Estudios in Mexico, Carlo Stella from Italy’s Mad Entertainment, Lindsey Adams from Ireland’s Daily Madness Productions, Jean-Françoise Tosti of Tat Productions in France, and Iryna Kostyuk from Ukraine’s Film.ua.Each studio had a different approach to the modern market and shared numerous blueprints for aspiring studios to emulate or combine. Kicking things off, Tosti explained that at TAT, “We look for a family audience, not just kids. We aim for the entire family.” The distinction is essential, he argued, and too often the two audiences are conflated. Family and children’s entertainment can take on entirely different tones, and TAT aims to be a staple of family movie nights.TAT look to develop its own ideas, rather than licensing IPs, and are completely independent in rolling its films out. “We invest a lot of our own money at the beginning [of a project], unsure if we’re going to make it back,” Tosti explained. “We go anyway.” This approach requires some flexibility. TAT is constantly shifting and evaluating the potential success of its projects, leaving room to either expand or reel a project in based on its predictions. It is a risky strategy founded on heavy market research and studying where the market may be going rather than emulating what is popular in the moment.Tv productions are the main focus at Daily Madness Productions, which hopes to expand into features eventually. In order to expand and raise the quality of the product more generally, a studio needs to acquire talent. The methods employed by Daily Madness require an ear close to the ground. “We love animation a lot, but not necessarily the industry infrastructure,” said Adams. “We try to pick up talent who have been left behind by other studios and try to amplify unrepresented voices.”Much of the work done by Daily Madness is service work, helping other studios realize their visions while providing extra funding for its own projects.Ánima in Mexico takes an alternative approach to engage audiences outside of traditional features or tv shows. Having started out making content for young adults, Ánima shifted its focus to kids’ tv, starting various Youtube channels for distribution. With around 40 million subscribers across its channels, the experiment has been successful.“For those who watch the show on the air, there is additional content on Youtube. For those who find the show on Youtube, there is additional content on the air,” explained de Letona. Original IP can be developed for two audiences simultaneously, strengthening the brand. Targeting children with short-form content in the modern day automatically means that Youtube must be part of any distribution plans.Original IP is not all that Ánima does, however. Anima is working on Batman Azteca, having licensed the property to put a local twist on the Caped Crusader. Licensing provides an alternative route for indie studios to gain popularity, but such licenses can be difficult to attain with many rights owners being overprotective with their property or opting for larger studios to interpret their characters.Bigger productions for Ánima are achieved through co-productions with other, often foreign, studios. De Letona described co-productions as “extremely valuable to making unique projects.” A larger budget allows you to push the visuals and storytelling further, resulting in a more expansive portfolio for the studio.Co-productions aren’t always the smartest move, as Iryna Kostyuk of UA Group found. Thew studio’s latest film, Mavka. The Forest Song has become the highest-grossing Ukrainian film of all time and was nearly a co-production.“After a year of negotiations we had five offers,” Kostyuk explained. “When you do a co-production, you have to do some production in that country. We calculated the costs and the co-production actually made it more expensive.” Balancing the scale of a project and the financial future of your company is a continual battle for indie studios. Kostyuk and UA bet on themselves through a pandemic and the Russian invasion, coming out with something revolutionary for the Ukrainian box office.Regional specificity is another characteristic of a studio that can manifest as a characteristic of its work. Telling local stories is close to the heart of Carlos Stella of Mad Entertainment who sees it as an opportunity to use film to communicate the unique Italian lifestyle. “All the stories we want to tell come from our territory,” was Stella’s mission statement for Mad Entertainment. He cited Studio Ghibli’s methods of storytelling and how universal principles are applied to very specific Japanese locations and characters. Stella looks to follow in the footsteps of how Ghibli “brought Japanese culture across the world,” applying that philosophy to Italian culture.Telling a localized story automatically means swimming against the tide of the mainstream idea of all elements of a film appealing to all possible audience members. Stella embraced this idea of rejecting four-quadrant storytelling, saying, “Independence is a great opportunity for the market to have something radical.”Independent animation is necessary for the market to be interesting. Those existing outside the sphere of big-budget crowd-pleasers can add variety and take risks. However, in the current industry, risks can only be made upon the most solid of foundations which are hard to come by. There is no set path, but embracing your local region, service work, providing a home for unrepresented talent, and betting on the stories you want to tell is a good place to start.",",,, Mad Entertainment, Lindsey Adams from Ireland’s Daily Madness Productions, Jean-Françoise Tosti of Tat Productions in France, and Iryna Kostyuk from Ukraine’s Film.ua.TAT are constantly shifting and evaluating the potential success of its projects.

box office report,https://www.cartoonbrew.com/box-office-report/elemental-the-flash-box-office-bombs-229848.html,‘Elemental’ Flops With Second-Worst Debut In Pixar History,Warner Bros.’s cg-heavy superhero epic ‘The Flash’ had a dire opening weekend of its own.,Jamie Lang,2023-06-19,"Pixar’s Elemental debuted over the weekend with the second-lowest three-day opening – for a wide release – in studio history at an estimated $29.5 million while Warner Bros.’s latest cg-heavy DC hero flick bombed with just $55.1 million grossed over the frame.The only Pixar film to ever make less than Elemental over a three-day opening was the original Toy Story, which made $29.1 million over its first three-day weekend. The debuts of the two films cannot really be compared, however, and Elemental being second-worst is merely a technicality. There is simply no historical precedent for a Pixar film opening as poorly as Elemental.Toy Story, for starters, opened on a Wednesday, so it had already made $9.9m before its $29.1m weekend. It also played in 1,500 fewer theaters than Elemental. And Toy Story opened multiple generations ago, in 1995, when the average U.S. movie ticket price was less than half of what it is today. Adjusted for inflation, Toy Story’s three-day weekend gross would be closer to $57 million today.Peter Sohn’s Elemental vs Andrés Muschietti’s The Flash was meant to be the box office battle that kicked off this summer’s theatrical season. Instead, the two films fell flat, failing to hit even their most modest predictions that had been lowered several times in recent weeks.Domestic box office prognosticators had The Flash tagged to debut at around $70 million and Elemental at $35 million. Those figures would have been seen as failures for either film. The fact that neither even came close is a disaster. According to The New York Times, both films had budgets exceeding $200 million.Things weren’t any better abroad, with Elemental only making $15 million from 17 markets and The Flash pulling in $75 million from 78 markets. With fairly weak competition, that meant The Flash finished first at the global box office, followed by Transformers: Rise of the Beasts, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, and Elemental in fourth.It’s fair to say that Elemental has been the biggest bust in Pixar’s history, but it’s also important to look at the circumstances that led to this point. By most accounts, Elemental isn’t a bad film. Critics have mostly liked or at least tolerated it, and audiences have generally enjoyed it. Elemental has an A Cinemascore, a 92% Rotten Tomatoes audience score, and strong Postrak results with 85% of those polled giving it a positive score and 68% saying they would recommend the film to others.So why did Elemental bomb so badly? Although the film’s recent reviews have been mostly positive, the film bombed with critics at its Cannes debut. More recent reviews have been far more enthusiastic about the film, but you never get a second chance at a first impression, and Elemental was introduced to the world as a dud at its high-profile French Riviera debut.There is also almost definitely some truth to the theory that Disney’s streaming-heavy distribution plans in recent years have caused severe damage to the theatrical prospects of its family-focused films. After sending title after title straight to Disney+ during and after the worst of the pandemic, short theatrical windows for many of its features since then have conditioned parents to save time and money by waiting for films to hit Disney+.It’s also almost certainly true that Pixar’s brand has been damaged. After years of no Pixar theatrical releases, Lightyear failed to launch with audiences and Disney’s Strange World probably caused some collateral damage as well.Making matters worse for the company’s distribution wing, Disney’s remakes have been struggling too. The Little Mermaid only managed to splash up $11.6 million domestically and $15.3 million internationally over the weekend, its fourth in theaters.Disney needs to hit it out of the park with Wish later this year. It’s still way too early to predict how that film will perform, or if it will be any good, but reactions after last week’s Annecy first look were favorable and there is a bit of buzz building around the film.It wasn’t all bad news at the Father’s Day weekend box office for animated films. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse was third domestically and globally, pulling in $27.8 million at home and $27.6 million abroad. The film’s domestic cume now sits at $280 million and its international at $209 million, putting the latest Spider-flick just short of the half-billion mark at $489 million grossed.",", Elemental debuts at around $70 million and Elemental at $35 million. Elemental was the second-lowest three-day opening – for a wide release – in studio history at an estimated $29.5 million. Toy Story, for starters, opened on a Wednesday, so it had already made $9.9m before its $29.1m weekend."
